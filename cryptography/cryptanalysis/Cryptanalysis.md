# Cryptanalysis

## Step-by-step guide for cryptanalysis using `cryptii`

### Step 1: Open the cryptii tool
[cryptii's website](https://cryptii.com/)

### Step 2: Choose the cipher type
@middle section
- `ENCODE`/`DECODE` 
- select encoding/decoding techniques

### Step 3: Enter the encrypted text in case you want to decrypt
@left side input box

e.g: 
```text
"Wklv lv d whvw phvvdjh."
```

### Step 4: Decrypt the cipher
e.g:
- **Caesar cipher**: if you know the key, you can perform the decryption by selecting the Shift value
  - Manual decryption: You can enter the shift value directly to decrypt the message. 
    - Try various shifts (usually between 1 and 25) to see if one produces a readable message. 
    - As you can see, with a shift value of 3, a readable plaintext is visible in the right text box.
