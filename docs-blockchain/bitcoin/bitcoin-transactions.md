# Bitcoin Transactions

## Bitcoin Transactions

### Scenario: Ross wants to send 5 BTC to Joey

Step 1: Joey shares his address with Ross

Step 2: Ross creates a transaction message and adds Joey’s address and 5 BTC to it

Step 3: Ross then signs the transaction with his private key and shares his public key to the network for signature verification

Step 4: Ross broadcasts the transaction on the Bitcoin network

### Security Measures preventing Double Spending Problem in Bitcoin

**Scenario**: If Joey uses his BTC in more than one transaction



#### Security Measures

* Transaction details are sent to all or as many nodes in the network
* Blockchain is constantly growing, and each peer maintains their copy of Blockchain
* Blockchain ensures that any modification in the block will lead to recomputing of the following blocks
* Anyone can validate the transactions and this validation prevents double spending



### Pseudonymity in Bitcoin

> **Pseudonymity**: the near-anonymous state in which users have disguised identities and do not disclose their true identities

* Bitcoin is a permissionless Blockchain where you don’t need to set up an account
* The public and private keys are generated by the wallet
* The address acts as an identifier or pseudonym of a user’s transaction



{% hint style="success" %}
#### Recommended by Satoshi Nakamoto: Users using a new address for each transaction

to avoid the transactions being linked to a common owner&#x20;

* If the same address is used for many transactions, then all of them will be linked.&#x20;
* Thus if your address get ever linked to your identity, then each and every transaction will be linked to you.
{% endhint %}



### Bitcoin Addresses

> The Bitcoin address corresponds to&#x20;
>
> a public key based on **`ECDSA`** (`Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm`) used in Bitcoin



* A wallet can have many such addresses and can be used for transactions



### `UTXOs`: Unspent Transaction Output &#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
UTXOs ➔ the fundamental building block of Bitcoin...
{% endhint %}



#### Scenario: Ross wants to send 0.15 BTC to Joey

Ross's wallet consist of total of 3.21 bitcoins distributed in 3 bytes&#x20;

<table data-header-hidden><thead><tr><th width="160.57421875" align="center"></th><th width="272.96484375"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><mark style="background-color:red;">0.2</mark> | <mark style="background-color:$info;">0.01</mark> | <mark style="background-color:$info;">3</mark> </td><td>Ross's wallet balance — before</td></tr></tbody></table>

* sending 0.15 BTC to Joey destroys the byte containing 0.2 BTC
* and remaining 0.05 BTC creates a new output of amount 0.05 BTC — it's available in another byte of Ross's wallet
* this reduces his balace to 3.06 BTC

### Bitcoin Transaction Structure

1. **Input**: the Bitcoin address that was used to send the Bitcoins to receiver in the first place
   * also defined as the UTXO: these Bitcoins have been received by the user in the past and have not been spent&#x20;
2. **Amount**: amount of Bitcoins that sender sends to the receiver
   * a new transaction that the sender is initiating where he uses receivers public key & his own private key to hash the transaction and send the sign
3. **Output**: sent to sender’s address as change
   * the balance amount is sent back to the receiver, it becomes the new UTXO for receivers wallet



Transaction structure in Bitcoin **reflects double-entry bookkeeping**

* Bitcoin transactions can be represented in the form of series of inputs and outputs
