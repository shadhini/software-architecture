## Bitcoin

<kbd>**digital money**</kbd>

#### 2 Major Operations

1. **Transaction Management**: transferring the coins from one address to another
2. **Currency generation**: regulating the monetary value



#### Bitcoin Controlled Supply

each block produced contains new Bitcoins created from nothing&#x20;

**total number of Bitcoins has a cap at 21M**

* Bitcoin supply is limited for the currency to have value
* a fundamental rule coded into the Bitcoin protocol by its creator and cannot be changed without overwhelming consensus across the network
* The rate of block creation is adjusted every 2016 blocks
  * @ the desired rate of one block per 10 mins —  2016 blocks should take exactly 2 weeks to mine
  * thus, if the last 2016 blocks has taken more than 2 weeks, the difficulty is reduced & vice versa
* As of late 2025, around 19.9 million Bitcoins have already been mined — less than 1.1 million remain to be created
* The mining process slows down over time due to periodic events called "**halvings**," which **reduce the reward** for mining new blocks **by half about every four years (every 210,000 blocks)**
* The **last Bitcoin** is expected to be mined around the year 2140



**Why the 21 million cap?**

* **Scarcity:** This fixed supply is designed to make Bitcoin deflationary and scarce, similar to precious metals like gold. Unlike fiat currencies, which can be endlessly printed by governments, Bitcoin offers predictability and discipline in monetary supply.
* **Inflation protection:** No more coins can ever be created above the cap, so Bitcoin is considered a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation.
* **Consensus and trust:** Changing this cap would undermine confidence in Bitcoin's value proposition and require unprecedented global consensus among all network participants





#### Ways to Get Bitcoins

A user must install a **wallet** on computer/mobile device, where Bitcoins can be received&#x20;



2 ways of buying Bitcoin

   * the **online exchange** then can be used to buy and sell Bitcoins on your behalf
   * you can connect one or more bank accounts to your exchange account&#x20;

   * choose a purchase method
