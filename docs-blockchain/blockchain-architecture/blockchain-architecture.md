# ✅ \*Blockchain Architecture

mysterious interruptions on blockchain network

chain of blocks

encryption failure — no

bad data storage on a single node — no

* blockchain isn't just about data

look at logs&#x20;

issue in the foundational architecture

not a flaw — but systemic

blockchain — distributed database; stored across multiple nodes with each holding a full copy

* problem isn't central

hash relationship tampering&#x20;

cryptographic hash — check those

* core security feature of blockchain&#x20;
* every block contains the hash of the previous block
* tampering with hash — entire chain collapses



consensus — referee

consensus mechanism isn't flagging anything — issue isn't a violation of rules



network layer diagnostics&#x20;

* connections between nodes are lagging — subtle issue  at the network layer





application layer — DApps running perfectly

data layer — intact&#x20;

network layer — communication & transaction propagation is failing

layers function together



public/private key architecture — if there's a vulnerability, it's here

cryptographic relationships within the blocks

cross-reference chains — to ensure integrity



each block carries

* transaction data&#x20;
* a hash — immutable unless someone has breached the system&#x20;



issue: a rogue DApp exploiting a smart contract loophole — flooding the network layer with unnecessary transactions



smart contracts — automated condition-based transactions

* one bad actor can bring everything down
* when an issue arises, you can patch the contract, isolate the DApp and strengthen the topology of the network&#x20;



every block, every chain, every key tells a story — it's easy to figure out issues if you know how to listen
