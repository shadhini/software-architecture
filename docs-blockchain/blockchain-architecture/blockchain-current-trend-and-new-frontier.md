# Blockchain Current Trend & New Frontier

## Blockchain Current Trend

### `DeFi`: Decentralized Finance

> **`DeFi`**&#x20;
>
> — use of blockchain technology to create **decentralized financial applications** —&#x20;
>
> offering services without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks
>
> * lending
> * borrowing
> * trading&#x20;
> * yield farming&#x20;

DeFi sector&#x20;

* has grown significantly
* a multitude of new projects and protocols offering innovative financial services

Challenges&#x20;

* regulatory scrutiny &#x20;
* security concerns

Potential

* potential for greater financial inclusion &#x20;
* potential for a more open financial ecosystem&#x20;



### `NFTs`: Non-Fungible Tokens

> **`NFTs`**&#x20;
>
> — unique digital assets that **represent ownership** of a specific item or piece of content —&#x20;
>
> often used for&#x20;
>
> * digital art
> * collectibles&#x20;
> * virtual real estate

NFTs popularity

* popularity has surged, with artists, musicians, and even traditional brands exploring their utility&#x20;
* NFTs offer creators a new way to monetize their work and engage with their audiences

The market&#x20;

* remarkable sales&#x20;
* debates about sustainability and copyright issues



### `CBDCs`: Central Bank Digital Currencies &#x20;

> development of digital versions of Central banks' national currencies

CBDCs could &#x20;

* offer more efficient payment systems
* enhance financial inclusion&#x20;

Digital Currencies

* provide central banks with better tools for monetary policy

The concept

* still in the experimental phase in many regions

Challenges with transition to CBDCs&#x20;

* addressing complex issues related to&#x20;
  * privacy
  * security&#x20;
  * financial stability



### **`SSI`**: Self-Sovereign Identity

**`SSI`**: Self-Sovereign Identity is a model for digital identity where individuals have full control over their data, managing it in a decentralized way without relying on a central authority

* If `A` launch a social media platform and if `B` go sign up for an account there, then `A` create a user identify for `B` and in `A`'s system and `A` manages `B`'s identity
* Unless `A` 's primary offering is identity management, `A` has to deal with something else outside his main offering&#x20;

in **`SSI`**, you're in custody of your own identity.&#x20;

* i.e: in the above example, `A` doesn't have to worry about `B` s identity. `B` can mange it's own identity by himself.



Current Trend:

* merge of the idea SSI: Self Sovereign Identity with personal medical data management



## New Frontiers

* Interoperability between Blockchains
* Quantum computing threats&#x20;
  * could break today’s cryptography
  * post-quantum cryptography
* Modular chains — advanced architectures
  * modular architectures — allow blockchains to specialize → solve the scalability trilemma in ways we couldn’t dream of a year ago
* zk-SNARKS
  * zero knowledge proofs — privacy layers we could add while still enabling verification
  * industries could adopt blockchain without risking sensitive data
