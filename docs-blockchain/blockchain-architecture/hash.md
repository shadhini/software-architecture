{% hint style="success" %}
A **cryptographic hash function** offers **one-way encryption**.

* No output can be reverse-engineered to its original input
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Often referred to as **digital thumbprints**.

* Each input produces a **unique output**
  * no 2 different inputs generates the same output
* but same output can be recreated by using the same input into the same function
{% endhint %}

#### Story: Thumbprint Cards Lucky Draw&#x20;

* thumbprints on index cards
* card drawn from hat&#x20;
* winning card posted in break-room
* employee can prove winning status by re-producing thumbprint



#### Hashes Usage

> Hashes are used all the time **as** leaving a marker or a **thumbprint of our data**,&#x20;
>
> **without actually storing that data itself**.



#### Hash Functions

* SHA-256 Hash
