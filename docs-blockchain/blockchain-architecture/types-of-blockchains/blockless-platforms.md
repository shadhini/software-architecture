# Blockless Platforms

## Blockless Platforms

> **Blockless Platforms**:
>
> Store transactions individually or as events, often using a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** or other structure.

#### Examples of Blockless Platforms

1. **IOTA (Tangle)**
   * Uses a DAG called "Tangle" instead of blocks.
   * Each new transaction confirms previous ones, leading to a web of transactions rather than a chain of blocks.
2. **Nano**
   * Uses a block-lattice structure, where each account has its own blockchain.
   * Transactions are not grouped into blocks but are recorded individually per account.
3. **Radix**
   * Uses a “Cerberus” consensus protocol and a sharded, blockless data structure for scalability.
4. **Hashgraph (Hedera)**
   * Uses a gossip protocol and virtual voting; transactions are not organized in blocks.
