{% hint style="info" %}
Web 3.0 envisions a future where **data** is&#x20;

* more **seamlessly connected**,&#x20;
* **accessible**, and&#x20;
* **understandable by both humans and machines**.

╰┈➤ Intelligent search engines & data interpretation

### Web 3.0 Key characteristics and Concepts



**Semantic Data:**

* focuses on making data more meaningful by adding context and semantics
* enables computers and applications to understand the relationships between different pieces of information
* data is structured in a way that allows machines to better interpret and process it
* semantic data allows more advanced searches, automated data processing, improved user experiences



**Linked Data:**

* promotes the use of linked data, which involves connecting pieces of information through standardized formats and protocols
* enables computers to navigate and explore the web of data in a more interconnected manner



**Decentralization:**

* core principal of Web 3.0
* instead of relying on central servers and intermediaries, Web 3.0 leverages decentralized technologies like blockchain and peer-to-peer networks to distribute data, applications, services and control across a network of nodes
* this enhances security, privacy, and user ownership of data — control over data



**Interoperability:**

* aims to break down data silos and enable interoperability between different platforms, services, and applications
* allows data & value to flow more freely and be used in diverse ways across various contexts



**Machine Understanding:**

* strives to make data more understandable for machines by adding semantic metadata and structured information
* enables automated processes, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms to make more informed decisions based on data



**Personalization and Al:**

* with improved data understanding, Web 3.0 can enable more personalized user experiences
* Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms can analyze user data to provide tailored content, recommendations, and services



**Enhanced Privacy and Security:**

* ﻿﻿decentralization and cryptographic techniques in Web 3.0 enhance privacy and security
* ﻿﻿users have greater control over their data&#x20;
* cryptographic techniques ensure that data remains secure and tamper-proof



**`WASM`**| **Web Assembly:**

* **`WASM`**: a technology that allows high-performance code to be executed securely across different platforms and browsers and environments
* ﻿﻿plays a role in making Web 3.0 applications more efficient and versatile



**Blockchain Technology:**

* foundational technology of Web 3.0
* enables the creation of smart contracts, digital identities, decentralized applications (DApps) that run without intermediaries



**Smart Contracts and DApps:**

* Web 3.0 introduces the concepts of smart contracts and DApps



**Improved User Control:**

* users have more control over their personal data
* ﻿﻿with technologies: self-sovereign identity, decentralized authentication&#x20;
  * users can manage their digital identities and selectively share information with trusted parties without relying on centralized authorities



**Digital Ownership and Tokens:**

* Web 3.0 introduces the concept of digital ownership through non-fungible tokens (**`NFTs`**) and other token standards
* NFTs: represent unique digital assets
  * allow creators to tokenize and sell digital art, collectibles, and other unique content on blockchain platforms
