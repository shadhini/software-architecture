# Blockchain Use-cases & Blockchain's Role

## Blockchain Use-cases&#x20;

blockchain enables

* recording of transactions
* tracking of assets within a business network
* providing a single source of truth

#### Balancing Act

The adoption of blockchain technology in many sectors required a careful balance between&#x20;

* the benefits of on-chain data for security and immutability and&#x20;
* the practicality of off-chain solutions for scalability

❗Finding the right balance is critical for successful blockchain integration.
