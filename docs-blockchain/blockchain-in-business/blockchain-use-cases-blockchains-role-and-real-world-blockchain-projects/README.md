* if the supply chain primarily operates within a closed ecosystem where trust is already well-established&#x20;

**When to Use Blockchain:**

* there is a need for increased transparency, trust, and traceability among multiple stakeholders, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers
* when the supply chain involves complex, global networks, and there is a desire to reduce fraud, errors and inefficiencies while ensuring the integrity of product information and transaction data throughout the entire process

**Application:**

* rich, detailed, audit trails to verify the authenticity of products
  * diamonds, expensive jewellery, seafood, electronics
* logs of what happened&#x20;

### `DeFi`: Decentralized Finance & Cross Border Payments&#x20;

**Desirable Attributes of Blockchain:**

* transparency
* immutable ledger — tamper-proof record
* smart contracts
* decentralized nature — borderless

**Nature of Use-case:**

* shared trust is critical

* reduce the need for intermediaries: people can access banking services, loans, and savings options without traditional financial intermediaries
* push financial inclusion to the next level — access + usage + quality
  * reduce the economic disparities experienced by marginalized communities
  * individuals and businesses — especially those that are poor, rural, women, or otherwise underserved — can access and effectively use affordable, appropriate financial services (payments, savings, credit, insurance, pensions) when they need them
* minimizes fraud — reduced risk of fraud and errors
* enable faster, more cost-effective cross-border payments and settlements
* ultimately improve efficiency and trust in financial processes

**When to Avoid Blockchain:**

* existing systems are already highly efficient&#x20;
* costs and complexities associated with blockchain implementation outweigh the potential benefits
* if a financial institution primarily operates in a closed and centralized environment where trust is well-established
* if regulatory compliance issues pose insurmountable challenges

**When to Use Blockchain:**

* there is a need for enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions, particularly in cross-border payments and settlements
* when the existing financial systems are burdened by intermediaries and complex reconciliation processes
  * as blockchain can streamline these operations and reduce costs while maintaining the integrity of financial data

**Application:**

* **`DeFi`**: Decentralized applications &#x20;
* cryptocurrency
* digital currencies
* cross-border payments
* **on-chain vs off-chain**
  * finding the right balance between transparency & scalability
* tokenized asset frameworks

**Platforms:**&#x20;

* provide real-time results
* potentially improve voter participation
* streamline election processes
* ensure the integrity of democratic systems

**Application:**

* municipal elections
* enhance trust in the democratic process/systems
* identity verification

**Benefits:**

* enhance transparency & security in elections

**Platforms:**&#x20;
