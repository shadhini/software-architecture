* tracking of assets within a business network
* providing a single source of truth
{% endhint %}

## Blockchain in Different Sectors

### Supply Chain Management

**Desirable Attributes of Blockchain:**&#x20;

* transparency
* traceability
* immutable ledger
* security
* smart contracts

**Nature of Use-case:**

* shared trust is critical

**Role of Blockchain & Value Added:**

✅ record every transaction and movement of goods on an immutable ledger

* an immutable ledger of transactions and events
* brings transparency, traceability, increased efficiency
* reduce fraud, errors, and delays&#x20;
* prevent counterfeiting
* enables real-time tracking of goods&#x20;
* provides a tamper-proof record of every step in the supply chain&#x20;
*   offers consumers assurance about the origin and authenticity of products&#x20;

    → enhance trust among participants&#x20;
* offer immense potential to streamline operations, improve accountability, and reduce costs for businesses

**When to Avoid Blockchain:**

* when the existing processes are straightforward and don't involve a multitude of parties or complex interactions
* if the cost and complexity of implementing blockchain technology outweigh the potential benefits
* if the supply chain primarily operates within a closed ecosystem where trust is already well-established&#x20;

**When to Use Blockchain:**

* there is a need for increased transparency, trust, and traceability among multiple stakeholders, such as manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, and consumers
* when the supply chain involves complex, global networks, and there is a desire to reduce fraud, errors and inefficiencies while ensuring the integrity of product information and transaction data throughout the entire process

**Application:**

* rich, detailed, audit trails to verify the authenticity of products
  * diamonds, expensive jewellery, seafood, electronics
* logs of what happened&#x20;
* **on-chain vs off-chain**
  * finding the right balance between transparency & scalability

**Platforms:**&#x20;

### Digital Identity

Application:

* identity verification
* DID: decentralized identity
* **`SSI`**: Self-Sovereign Identity is a model for digital identity where individuals have full control over their data, managing it in a decentralized way without relying on a central authority

### `DeFi`: Decentralized Finance & Cross Border Payments&#x20;

**Desirable Attributes of Blockchain:**

* transparency
* immutable ledger
* smart contracts
* decentralized nature — borderless

**Nature of Use-case:**

* shared trust is critical

**Role of Blockchain & Value Added:**

✅️ streamlines cross-border transactions and reduced fraud

* secure, transparent, immutable ledger for financial transactions
* reduce the need for intermediaries: people can access banking services, loans, and savings options without traditional financial intermediaries
* push financial inclusion to the next level — access + usage + quality
  * reduce the economic disparities experienced by marginalized communities
  * individuals and businesses — especially those that are poor, rural, women, or otherwise underserved — can access and effectively use affordable, appropriate financial services (payments, savings, credit, insurance, pensions) when they need them
* minimizes fraud — reduced risk of fraud and errors
* enable faster, more cost-effective cross-border payments and settlements
* ultimately improve efficiency and trust in financial processes

**When to Avoid Blockchain:**

* existing systems are already highly efficient&#x20;
* costs and complexities associated with blockchain implementation outweigh the potential benefits
* if a financial institution primarily operates in a closed and centralized environment where trust is well-established
* if regulatory compliance issues pose insurmountable challenges

**When to Use Blockchain:**

* there is a need for enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions, particularly in cross-border payments and settlements
* when the existing financial systems are burdened by intermediaries and complex reconciliation processes
  * as blockchain can streamline these operations and reduce costs while maintaining the integrity of financial data

**Application:**

* **`DeFi`**: Decentralized applications &#x20;
* digital currencies
* cross-border payments
* **on-chain vs off-chain**
  * finding the right balance between transparency & scalability

**Platforms:**&#x20;

### Civic Governance & Voting Systems&#x20;

Desirable Attributes of Blockchain:

* transparency&#x20;
* decentralized nature — no central control
* security

Application:

* municipal elections
* trust in the democratic process
* identity verification

Benefits:

* enhance transparency & security in elections

Platforms:&#x20;

### Healthcare

**Desirable Attributes of Blockchain:**

* facilitate secure sharing of data&#x20;
* immutable ledger&#x20;
* decentralized nature

**Nature of Use-case:**

* medical histories
* shared trust is critical

**Role of Blockchain & Value Added:**

✅️ enhances security, integrity and interoperability of patient data

* enables secure sharing of medical records
* ensure patient privacy&#x20;
* ensures patient consent management
* ensure data accuracy
* improve accessibility
* simplifies administrative processes
* leads to improved patient care
* reduced costs&#x20;

**When to Avoid Blockchain:**

* when the current data management systems are highly effective &#x20;
* the costs and complexities of adopting  blockchain outweigh the expected improvements
* if a healthcare organization primarily operates in a an isolated ecosystem where data sharing and interoperability are not critical concerns&#x20;
* if regulatory and compliance challenges cannot be adequately addressed

**When to Use Blockchain:**

* when there's a pressing need for secure, interoperable, and patient-centric health data management
* when improving data sharing among healthcare providers, enhancing patient consent management, and ensuring the integrity of medical records
* ultimately leads to better patient care, streamlined processes, and reduced medical errors

**Application:**

* facilitate secure & interoperable sharing of healthcare data among different providers&#x20;
* empower patients to control their own health records&#x20;
* **on-chain vs off-chain**
  * ✅️ hybrid models with off-chain storage to keep it scalable
    * on-chain health data — ensures integrity and trust&#x20;
    * off-chain methods — help manage the complexity of healthcare system and regulations
    * facilitate secure exchange of patient information leading to more efficient and patient-centered healthcare
  * striking a balance between data security and interoperability

**Platforms:**&#x20;
