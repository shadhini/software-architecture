# Blockchain: Value Proposition

{% hint style="info" %}
**Value proposition**:&#x20;

* benefits, value, or unique advantages that a product/service/company offers to its customers
* explains why a customer should choose that over competitors
{% endhint %}

## Blockchain: Value Proposition

**primary value — `accuracy`**

> If I **record a false statement on-chain**,
>
> &#x20;     I loose the ability to claim I never made the statement...
>
> — **The proof of my lie is accurately recorded in blockchain!** —&#x20;

### Accuracy vs Truth

❌ Misconception:&#x20;

"<kbd>Data on a blockchain must be true, because it's on a blockchain!</kbd>"

╰┈➤ Blockchains provide **high levels of accuracy**, but **not necessarily truth**

* we can have high confidence that&#x20;
  * the data recorded on block is what was submitted to the network — it hasn't been tampered after recording
* but record can be an **accurate version of a lie**

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you want a blockchain solution to be able to **verify** whether a particular piece of **data is true or not**,&#x20;

╰┈➤  that's going to involve **you providing additional logic** to your solution so that they can **make those determinations**
{% endhint %}
