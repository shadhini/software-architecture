## Blockchain Iceberg

{% hint style="info" %}
`[currently]` **In the blockchain world, consumer applications tend to get most of the attention .**

This is also true for blockchain platforms.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Enterprises always feel like they’re moving beneath the surface

Because they’re not chasing visibility—they’re building foundations.&#x20;

And that’s where the real value lies.
