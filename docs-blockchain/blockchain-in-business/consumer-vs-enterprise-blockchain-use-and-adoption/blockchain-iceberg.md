# Blockchain Iceberg

## Blockchain Iceberg

> **Blockchain Iceberg analogy** explains the visibility gap between consumer and enterprise blockchain applications

{% hint style="info" %}
`[currently]` **In the blockchain world, consumer applications tend to get most of the attention .**

This is also true for blockchain platforms.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Enterprises always feel like they’re moving beneath the surface

Because they’re not chasing visibility—they’re building foundations.&#x20;

And that’s where the real value lies.

* what's visible above the water-line is the minority: very small portion from the entire thing



**Gartner** estimates blockchain will generate $3.1 trillion in new business value by 2030

* A significant portion of this value will be generated by enterprise solutions
* These solutions often operate behind the scenes and are largely unnoticed by the public
  * Example: Walmart's use of blockchain to track produce

A significant part of the market responsible for driving blockchain's growth is being largely ignored...

* ﻿﻿Disruptive technology generally enjoys consumer usage first and enterprise usage second
  * ﻿﻿Internet, Personal Computers, Cellular / Mobile / Smart Phones, Social Media
