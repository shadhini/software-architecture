# Enterprise Use Cases

## Factors that drive enterprise blockchain use&#x20;

* ﻿﻿Desire for equal amounts of power and control between participants
* Need for transparency between participants
* Highly regulated / audited business processes
  * ﻿﻿Data consumption needs to be an auditable activity

## Enterprise Blockchain Use Cases

**Intercompany accounting**

* Intercompany clearance and settlement often involves multiple legacy systems and many disparate data sources
* Reconciliation is frequently delayed after the transaction is complete

  * Especially in mergers and acquisitions by creating a shared, immutable record of transfers



**Trusted data-sharing among third parties**

* Data access and sharing among third parties are typically restricted
  * Due to technology silos and privacy concerns
* Permissioned blockchain platforms enable organizations to securely exchange data
  * Trusted third parties have only the specific levels of data access needed



**Pharmaceutical Tracking and Authentication**

* ﻿﻿Track and authenticate the entire lifecycle of pharmaceutical products
* Ensure authenticity
* ﻿﻿Reduce counterfeit drugs



**Improve patient safety**

* ﻿﻿Luxury Goods Authentication
* ﻿﻿Verify the authenticity and provenance of high-value items
* ﻿﻿Prevent circulation of counterfeit products in the market



**Warranty Management**

* Manufacturers can create a transparent and tamper-proof record of product warranties and maintenance history



**Shipping and Freight Logistics**

* Streamline documentation and communication in shipping and freight logistics&#x20;
* Reduce paperwork, enhance transparency, improve the efficiency of global trade



**Identity Verification for `KYC`/`AML`**

## Enterprise Blockchain Use Case Challenges

* integration with legacy systems/existing systems
  * enterprises aren't starting from scratch
  * they're layering blockchain onto complex infrastructures
* governance structures
  * no clear structure — enterprise blockchains fail to scale
* security requirements



**Non Concerns**
