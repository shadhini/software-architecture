# When to use Blockchain and avoid Blockchain?

## Summary: When to use Blockchain and avoid Blockchain

Blockchain technology is appropriate, when

✅ data immutability is important

✅  a decentralized network is preferred

* no single participant should have disproportional authority / power

✅  trust & transparency is required

✅  need to track history/lifecycle/custody chain of assets — **rich & detailed audit trails**

✅ when multiple parties need a shared, immutable source of truth — **systems integration — large cross-organizational audience**

* participants do not trust each other — shared resources can't be kept by one party
* integrate disparate line of business (LoB) systems across organizational boundaries — persist state across LoB applications

✅ as IT infrastructure — to developing countries where you cannot rely on critical infrastructure being available

✅ enhance legacy system with another layer on top of it&#x20;

✅ connect legacy systems with a shared, permanent, decentralized audit trail

✅ all other solution possibilities other than blockchain have been ruled out

* technical limitations
* non technical (human) barriers around control, authority, power



Blockchain technology is not appropriate, when

❌ real-time transaction speed is crucial

❌ data that needs constant updates&#x20;

❌ **Centralized control** is desired&#x20;

❌ **Data must be destroyed**, cannot be permanent; data retention & lifecycle requirements&#x20;

❌ **Data sovereignty** is a concern — you need to be able to determine where data is stored and how

❌ **Speed, efficiency and performance** are top solution requirements/concerns&#x20;

❌ Working with **highly confidential data**, security is a **top concern**  (for the moment — due to short production lifespan of blockchain technology )

❌ requires exact timing, perfect coordination or exact synchronization

❌ prefer closed-source software, tooling, components

❌ solution to be used internally by a single organization

❌ objectives can be achieved using conventional (pre-blockchain) technology
