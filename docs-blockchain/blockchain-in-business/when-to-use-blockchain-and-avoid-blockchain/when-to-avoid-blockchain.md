# When to avoid Blockchain

## When to avoid Blockchain



* **Centralized control** is desired&#x20;
* **Data must be destroyed**, cannot be permanent
  * scenarios with extensive data retention & lifecycle requirements&#x20;
    * data retention: storing information for a specified period (and then destroyed) to meet legal, regulatory, and business needs, such as compliance, data analytics, and operational continuity
  * e.g: **`GDPR`**: the privacy protection regulations in the EU
    * `GDPR` dictates that `"personal information"` regarding any user must be deleted from all systems upon request by that user
    * penalties for non-compliance can be severe!
* **Data sovereignty is a concern**
  * sovereignty — supreme power or authority
    * you need to be able to determine where data is stored and how
    * e.g: When there are regulations requiring data to be stored in specific locations, such as within national borders
  * blockchain is not the best fit — alternatively can consider private blockchain networks where access and membership can be controlled by solution owners&#x20;
* **Speed and performance** are top solution requirements/concerns&#x20;
  * centralized components will always out-perform their decentralized counterparts
  * blockchain is several orders of magnitude slower than centralized counterparts — intentionally inefficient solution to the problem
    * benefits such as data security, data integrity, redundancy, fault tolerance, fail over ...
    * at the expense of efficiency, speed and performance
* Working with **highly confidential data**, security is a **top concern**
  * despite many inherent security advantages, it cannot be forgotten that blockchain is relatively new technology with short production lifespan
  * best practices, anti-patterns to avoid, resources to consult for managing confidential/secure data in databases already exist and have been verified to work in the real world
