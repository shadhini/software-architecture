# Blockchain as a Shared IT Infrastructure

### **Shared IT Infrastructure** (between participants)

* participants do not trust each other enough to grant exclusive control over management of the data repository of shared resources to one party
* if you want to deploy services to developing parts of the world where you may not always be able to rely on critical infrastructure being available
  * power coming and going
  * network connectivity being periodic
* if high transparency is desirable — nonprofit show donors/potential donors how funds are allocated and spent providing re assurance that  funds are being used responsibly&#x20;

#### Reason: Contributing Blockchain Features

* extreme fault tolerance & excellent resiliency
  * multiple copies of the ledger are maintained on a **peer-to-peer network** — a network of equally privileged and equally capable peers
    * no single point of failure
    * redundancy and fail over capability
* high degree of transparency & ability for large audiences to validate data&#x20;
  * decentralized ledger
  * cryptographic linking of blocks of data — data integrity
  * high confidence that recorded data has not been tampered with or altered since the time it was recorded

### Example Use-case: `Intel` wants to partner with `Samsung` to design a new chip for mobile phones

* output of their work together:&#x20;
  * technical designs
  * documents
  * charts
  * spreadsheets
  * diagrams
  * emails
  * miscellaneous files: general-purpose or uncategorized files that don’t fit neatly into the main structure of a project
