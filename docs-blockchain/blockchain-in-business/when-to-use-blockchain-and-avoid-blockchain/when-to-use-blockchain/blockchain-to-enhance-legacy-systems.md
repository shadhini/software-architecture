# Blockchain to enhance Legacy Systems

### Enhanced **Legacy Systems**&#x20;

* not to replace, but to enhance
* if it make sense to layer blockchain on top of existing system
* opportunities/capabilities that appear when connecting legacy systems to a larger world — when connecting transactions between different legacy systems

#### Reason: Contributing Blockchain Features

* permanent, decentralized audit trail



### Example Use-case: Potential implications of connecting a manufacturer's legacy ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system to a reseller's legacy CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system&#x20;

* manufacturing against incoming orders could happen immediately&#x20;
* a detailed log of interaction between reseller and manufacturer can be maintained&#x20;
  * this log is maintained by both parties in consensus with each other&#x20;

❗ Blockchain is used to only connect the ERP & CRM system, not to replace them.

Retailer's meeting with the customer results in customer placing a large initial order. We want this order information retailer enters in to their CRM system to be cascade to manufacturer's ERP system so that manufacturer can start manufacturing items to fulfil this order with zero delay.

* traditional ERP & CRM system integration
  * involves creating a rigid coupling / rigid integration between the manufacturer's ERP system & retailer's CRM system
  * these type of integrations are&#x20;
    * fragile; break frequently &#x20;
    * when they do break, they can be very expensive and time consuming to fix
* ✅ **putting a blockchain network between these 2 systems**
  * we are keeping a permanent, decentralized audit trail of all the transactions move between retailer & manufacturer



### Example Use-case: iPhone —  If you have a question about an iPhone, who do you ask?

<table><thead><tr><th width="134.18359375">Vendor</th><th>when they engage iPhone development</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong><code>Apple</code></strong></td><td><ul><li>design the iPhone</li><li>determines technical capabilities and features</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>Foxconn</code></strong></td><td><ul><li>manufacturers iPhones for Apple</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><strong><code>Maersk</code></strong></td><td><ul><li>delivers shipping containers filled with iPhones around the world</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><code>UPS</code></strong>/</p><p><strong><code>FedEx</code></strong>/</p><p><strong><code>DHL</code></strong></p></td><td><ul><li>delivers iPhones to recipients around the world</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong><code>Verizon</code></strong>/</p><p><strong><code>Orange</code></strong>/</p><p><strong><code>Singel</code></strong></p></td><td><ul><li>provides network access and retail services for iPhone device</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

👉 A blockchain ledger allows multiple parties to contribute and share information in a space which is not exclusively owned or controlled by any single of them
