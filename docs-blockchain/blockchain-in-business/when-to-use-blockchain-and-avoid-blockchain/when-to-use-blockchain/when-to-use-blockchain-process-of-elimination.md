{% endhint %}



#### Questions to Consider

1. Does the use of blockchain in this case **add additional value or functionality** that **cannot be added by any other technology**?

   * No ❌ — revise other technologies
2. Doe the use of this technology enable my users to:
   1. Do **something they could not do before** or
   2. To **do something better than they could before**
3.  Can I **explain** the **value** of my proposed solution **without using the word "blockchain" or "decentralized ledger"**?
