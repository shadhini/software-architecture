# Blockchain Security Benefits

## Blockchain Security Benefits



* **Decentralization**
  * no one party or participant can gain disproportionate levels of control or authority
    * networks owners need to agree on changes before they are made
  * useful for modeling decentralized activities in the real world&#x20;
    * supply chains, roadways, public events ...
  * **no** (or limited) **single points of failure**
  * on a true P2P network, all nodes are copies of each other — extremely **fault tolerant**&#x20;
  * multiple copies of the ledger require attackers to attack more than one place
* **Record the process and the data together**
  * **smart contracts** are often used to model real world processes
  * smart contracts are often stored on-chain (pure blockchains such as `Ethereum`)
  * permanent record of the data and the process that generated the data on one ledger&#x20;
    * old smart contract versions won't go away
* **Immutability** of the ledger
  * extremely difficult to change, alter, or delete ledger data
  * preserves the accuracy of recorded data
* **Cryptography**
  * public key cryptography used to validate transaction participants — signatures
  * hashes used to link blocks and maintain ledger integrity
* **Consensus Mechanisms**&#x20;
  * Proof of Work consensus has enjoyed a solid 15 year track record of exceptional performance and reliability
    * sufficiently large PoW networks have never been compromised at least not at the protocol level
    * most of the times, when you hear blockchain being attacked, it is about insecure application or smart contract code written on top of the secure platform
  * Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus allows for a high degree of trust in the accuracy of ledger data
  * hacking modern consensus methods often requires extensive time, computational power and financial resources — this reduces the financial appeal of conducting such attacks&#x20;
* **Transparent and Auditable**
  * high-transparent data enhances accountability and reduces the risk of fraudulent activities
  * auditors and external parties can independently verify data and ensure regulatory/legal compliance
* **Data encryption and Privacy**
  * permissioned blockchains ensure data is only consumable by the proper identities, under the proper circumstances
    * helps ensure sensitive information is never disclosed to unauthorised users
    * reading of ledger data can be recorded on the ledger as well&#x20;
      * data reading can become an auditable event
* **Fault tolerance and Resilience**
  * due to the use of P2P network architecture, blockchain is highly fault-tolerant
  * this resilience make blockchain suitable for critical applications such as financial systems, emergency resource management, and censorship-resistant information dissemination
  * ideal for use in areas where infrastructure cannot be depended on
