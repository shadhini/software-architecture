# Blockchain Security Concerns

## Blockchain Security Concerns

✅ application running on Secure Networks

* blockchain protocol is running on a standard TCP/IP computer network&#x20;

✅ application built on a Secure Blockchain Protocol

✅ Secure Middle Layer

✅ Secure Smart Contracts

✅ other solution artifacts secure

* user interface

✅ Security Concerns to consider on the client side

* will users be using potentially insecure devices or connections
* you don't have any control over client environment — make sure to **consider the worst case scenario** about what that client environment might be



* every blockchain solution running smart contracts is running on top of a **blockchain protocol**; a **network protocol** being run on the network
* and that protocol is running on a standard **TCP/IP computer network**&#x20;
* this means that there may be vulnerabilities that exist below your **smart contract**;&#x20;
  * either the **protocol layer** or **network layer** as well
