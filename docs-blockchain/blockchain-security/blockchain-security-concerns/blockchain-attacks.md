# Blockchain Attacks

### 51% Attack

{% hint style="info" %}
On a **Proof of Work** network, one of the most common attack vectors is **51% attack**.
{% endhint %}

> when an attacker or malicious actor gains **control of 51% or more of the total computational power** on the network

* any attacker who controls the majority of the computational power on the network is in a position to create an alternate or divergent chain containing or ignoring the transactions that malicious actor desires&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Attacks at the network level** might help **facilitate attacks like 51% attack**.
{% endhint %}



### XX% Attack

> Attackers who can **control a significant portion of the network's "scarce" resource** can affect what gets recorded to the ledger&#x20;
>
> * **computing power** in **PoW**
> * **staking funds** in **PoS**
> * ... etc

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Smaller networks** are generally more susceptible to these types of attacks.
{% endhint %}



## Sybil Attacks

> Someone **flooding** the network with **fake nodes**

* Consensus mechanisms like proof of stake, ensures only trusted nodes participate
