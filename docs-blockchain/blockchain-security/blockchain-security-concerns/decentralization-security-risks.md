# Decentralization Security Risks

## Decentralization Security Risks

* no centralized control
  * **decisions** generally **take** **longer**
  * **governance** is more **complicated**
* very new technology
  * new, uneducated users may not understand risks
  * **new attack vectors** still being discovered
  * technology is **evolving quickly**, code written today will likely need to be refactored tomorrow
    * the platforms of today might not be there tomorrow — anyone remember `Lycos`, `GeoCities`, and `Netscape`
    * things like backward compatibility may not be guaranteed on blockchain platforms
* building on blockchain requires a **new way of thinking**
  * "Safe" activities on client-server networks can be catastrophic on peer-to-peer networks
  * problems like **deterministic concurrency** and **phantom queries** can be very difficult for developers to avoid, because thee are patterns which present absolutely no problem when implemented in a client-server environment&#x20;
