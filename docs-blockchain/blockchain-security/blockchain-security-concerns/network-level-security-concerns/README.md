# Network Level Security Concerns

## Network Level Vulnerabilities

Blockchains are a network protocol, they run on standard computer networks

* Even if the blockchain platform is secure, the network may be at risk!



**Network communications and pathways can be manipulated to facilitate an attack**

* many architects have created robust and secure blockchain solutions, only to introduce a **single point of failure at the network layer**
* consider bringing network security expertise to your project team — to analyze attack vectors on TCP/IP networks



## Network Level Security Attack Vectors

#### `DoS`: Denial of Service Attacks
