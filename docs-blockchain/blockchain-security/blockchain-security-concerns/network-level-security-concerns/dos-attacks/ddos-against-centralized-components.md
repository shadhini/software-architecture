# DDoS against Centralized Components

### **DDoS against Centralized Components on a Permissioned blockchain**

Denial of Service attack against certain centralized components on a private/permissioned blockchain like `Hyperledger`&#x20;

* permissioned blockchains are not client-server systems, but not quite peer-to-peer systems either
* they are bit more centralized than permissionless blockchains like `Ethereum` — and often have centralized components&#x20;

#### **DDoS MSP on Hyperledger**

&#x20;DDoS attack on `MSP` (`Membership Service Provider`) on `Hyperledger`&#x20;

* The MSP serves as the roster or directory of all valid identities at a given organization on the network
* By launching a denial of service attack against this key centralized component and bringing this node offline, an attacker could potentially bring down the entire network&#x20;
  * at least attacker can bring down all the transactions involving the affected organization
