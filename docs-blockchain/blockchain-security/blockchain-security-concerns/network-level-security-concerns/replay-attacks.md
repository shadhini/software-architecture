# Replay Attacks

## Replay Attacks

> **Resubmit** an existing transaction to the blockchain as a new transaction

* Every **transaction** submitted to the network is **signed with a private key** value to prevent forgeries and validate the identity
  * an attacker can't forge a digital signature without access to a user's private key
  * but an attacker could **resubmit** an existing transaction to the blockchain **as a new transaction**
  * if the data contained in the transaction is unchanged, the original digital signature will still be valid
  * ╰┈➤ the attacker could "**replay**" **transactions** where they receive coins multiple times
