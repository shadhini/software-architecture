# Privacy Violations & Regulatory Challenges

## Privacy Violations & Regulatory Challenges



#### Privacy Violations

* Data which is mistakenly or maliciously recorded to the ledger is permanent
* Do you have governance and oversight in place to help prevent these kind of activities from occurring  ?
  * No — make sure you get that governance plan in place before before you start playing around seriously with blockchain technology



#### Regulatory Challenges

* Blockchain data is permanent but rules, regulations, and laws are ever-changing
* Data recorded today may be in compliance, but what about tomorrow?
  * **compliance needs to be considered upfront**
  * you have to try to **future-proof your solutions**&#x20;
  * You need to make sure your solution would be complaint with future regulatory/legal requirements too — if you are not sure, you need to consult experts in the field
