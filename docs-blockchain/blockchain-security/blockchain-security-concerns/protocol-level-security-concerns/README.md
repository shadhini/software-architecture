# Protocol Level Security Concerns

## Protocol Level Vulnerabilities

* Every blockchain **platform** brings its **own** unique **vulnerabilities**
  * Make sure you understand the weaknesses of a platform before building on it&#x20;
* **Updates** and changes **to** the **protocol** may introduce **new** **vulnerabilities**
  * it's not uncommon for developers at the protocol level to address one bug and inadvertently introduce another&#x20;
  * Consider creating a private test network instance that you can use to test upgrades, patches, and new versions before applying them to production or `Mainnet` nodes
