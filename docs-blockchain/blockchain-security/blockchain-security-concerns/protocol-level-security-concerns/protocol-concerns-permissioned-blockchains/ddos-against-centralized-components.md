# DDoS against Centralized Components

### **DDoS against Centralized Components on a Permissioned blockchain**

Denial of Service attack against certain centralized components on a hybrid/permissioned blockchain like `Hyperledger`&#x20;

* permissioned blockchains are not client-server systems, but not quite peer-to-peer systems either — they are bit more centralized than permissionless blockchains like `Ethereum`

#### **DDoS MSP on Hyperledger**

* e.g: `MSP` (`Membership Service Provider`) on `Hyperledger`&#x20;
  * By launching a denial of service attack against this key centralized component, an attacker could potentially bring down the entire network&#x20;
