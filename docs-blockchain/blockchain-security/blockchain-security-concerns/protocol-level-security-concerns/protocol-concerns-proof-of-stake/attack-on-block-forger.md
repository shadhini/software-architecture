# Attack on Block Forger

## **Attack on Block Forger**

* on Proof of Stake network, a Block Forger Attack can occur where we front run the selection logic to see who the next validator is going to be&#x20;
* If \`**A**\` is an attacker, know who the next block validator is going to be, before that validator has been selected by the network, \`**A**\` could flood that validating node with traffic&#x20;
* launching a denial of service attack against that node will prevent if from responding in a timely fashion, thus slowing down the overall network and making it easier for \`**A**\` to introduce a divergent or alternate version of the ledger
