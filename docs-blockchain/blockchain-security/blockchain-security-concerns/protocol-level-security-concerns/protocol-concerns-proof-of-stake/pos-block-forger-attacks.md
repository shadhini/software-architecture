# PoS Block Forger Attacks

## **PoS Block Forger Attacks**

> vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors that a validator (aka "block forger"/ "staker") could exploit in PoS blockchains
>
> * when a validator abuses its role in proposing/attesting blocks—e.g., by creating conflicting blocks, withholding blocks, or censoring—to gain extra rewards, enable double-spends, or disrupt consensus



Examples:

* `Long-Range Attack`
* `Block Timestamp Manipulation`
* Nothing-at-Stake Attack
* Stake Grinding
* Censorship and Transaction Withholding
