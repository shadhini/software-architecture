# PoS Time-bomb

## PoS Time-bomb

> **Rich get richer problem**

* sits right at the intersection of technological capability & human psychology and motivation
  * many people argue that PoS Time-bomb problem is a problem that is endemic to human society and human systems, not necessarily a technical problem
  * and therefore **nothing** that **can be addressed via technology**
* in proof-of-stake, a validator's block reward is proportional to the number of coins that they've staked — this means, if the richest user on the network continually stakes all of their coins, their stake is going to grow faster than anybody else's&#x20;
* if this happens long enough, eventually that one single user is going to control most of the coins on the network — and then that use gains a disproportionate amount of control
* some blockchains attempt to **limit the maximum block reward** that's payable in order to avoid this
  * however, this check can be **easily** [**circumvented**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1] by just setting up multiple nodes or wallets or accounts&#x20;
* this can cause the network to **slow down** significantly&#x20;
