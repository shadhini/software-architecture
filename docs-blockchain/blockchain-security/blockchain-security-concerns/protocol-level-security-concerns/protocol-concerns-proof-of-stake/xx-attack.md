# XX% Attack

## XX% Attack

> Attackers who can **control a significant portion of the network's "scarce" resource** can affect what gets recorded to the ledger&#x20;
>
> * **computing power** in **PoW** → 51% attack
> * ✓ **staking funds** in **PoS** → XX% attack
> * ... etc

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Smaller networks** are generally more susceptible to these types of attacks.
{% endhint %}

* similar to 51% attack in proof of work&#x20;
* depending on how Proof of Stake network is configured, it **may take more than 51%**&#x20;
* in a PoS network, users with a larger stake have a larger influence on consensus
* controlling a majority of the staked coins opens up the potential for **double-spends**
  * the exact amount varies based on the network and its coins
* `[in theory]`  XX% attack is **protected** against by the **theory of supply and demand**&#x20;
  * if some attacker is purchasing all of the cryptocurrency in order to control the majority of what's staked, the economics of supply and demand tells us that the price of those remaining coins is going to continue going up and up as their supply dwindles&#x20;
  * eventually, the price of those coins may get so high that performing this kind of attack is no longer financially possible/feasible/valuable
