# Physical Attacks

## Physical Attacks

> **Physical Network Attacks**&#x20;

* Physical network attacks can be used against PoW networks
  * Proof of work consumes large amounts of electricity
  * economies of scale have centralized mining operations in regions of the world with cheap electricity
    * if you have a lot of centralized mining power in large data centers in regions of the world with cheap electricity, you have centralization risk
  * an attack that **cut the power** to a certain geographic region, or even datacenter, that hosted a lot of mining resources could have a major effect on the size of a mining network — could bring a lot of the network down
  * by **reducing the overall size of the network**, a **51% attack** can be **launched** **with** a **smaller number** of resources
