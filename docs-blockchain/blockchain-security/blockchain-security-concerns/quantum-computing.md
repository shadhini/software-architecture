# Quantum Computing

## Quantum Computing

{% hint style="warning" %}
We don't know exactly when s**ufficiently powerful quantum computers will become a reality**,&#x20;

but we are getting very close to that point !
{% endhint %}

* A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could break existing encryption, hack and re-encrypt ledger data, and monopolize consensus activities
* Many **quantum-proof encryption methods** exist, but are not currently being implemented
* It should be noted that **quantum computers pose an enormous security risk** to centralized systems and solutions as well !
