# Scalability Issues & Security

## Scalability Issues & Security

* Large public blockchains (`Bitcoin`, `Ethereum`) don't scale up very well
* As networks grow, performance can suffer and costs can go up



### Blockchain Trilemma

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Blockchain Trilemma

Security can be traded for decentralization and/or scalability ...

Have you found the right mix ?

* If blockchain network grows, security increases — performing a 51% attack on a network of 10 nodes is much easier than doing the same thing on a network of 100 nodes&#x20;
* But, as these networks scale up, their performance is correspondingly going to drop
