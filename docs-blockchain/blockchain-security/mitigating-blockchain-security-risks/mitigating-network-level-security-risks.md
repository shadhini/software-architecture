# Mitigating Network Level Security Risks

## Mitigating Network Level Security Risks



* consider **bringing** **network security expertise** to your project team — to analyze attack vectors when running blockchain on TCP/IP networks&#x20;

#### Eclipse Attacks

* make sure your **nodes** are **secure** and **malware/virus free**
* can run **anti-virus**, **anti-malware** protection algorithms



#### Replay Attacks

* Replay attacks can be mitigated at the **protocol level** by **forcing** the **inclusion of unique** transaction **data**&#x20;
  * this piece of unique data is often called the **`"block nonce"`** — this is NOT the same as the nonce miners compete to find during validation

#### Sybil Attacks

* `Consensus mechanisms` like proof of stake, ensures only trusted nodes participate
