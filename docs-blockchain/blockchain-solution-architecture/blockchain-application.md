# Blockchain Application:

## Blockchain Application: Components

#### Node Application

> each node has to install and run a computer application definitive to the ecosystem

e.g: `Bitcoin Wallet` application in `Bitcoin` ecosystem



#### Shared Ledger

> a ledger is managed inside the node application whose contents can be viewed once the application is running

e.g: if one is running a `Bitcoin client`, they can participate in the `Bitcoin` ecosystem based on rules set in the `Bitcoin` node application



#### Consensus Algorithm

> provides the rule for how the ecosystem will arrive at a single view in a ledger, and how it will be implemented as a part of node application

* the method used to determine the `world state` of the ecosystem



#### Virtual Machine

> an abstraction of instruction-operated machine implemented as a part of the node application



## Blockchain Application Templates

#### Types of Templates

  * used for applications where a user sets up the contracts for a specific purpose
* <mark style="color:$success;">**One to One**</mark>
  * user for applications which involve financial contracts between 2 entities
