# Blockchain Network: Building Blocks

#### Blockchain Network: Building Blocks&#x20;

* **Consensus** Mechanism: govern how transactions are validated & added to the blockchain
* Data Structure: blocks linked together in a chain&#x20;
  * each block carries
    * set of transactions
    * a hash — immutable unless someone has breached the system&#x20;
    * a reference to the previous block &#x20;
* Cryptographic Hash Function
  * e.g: SHA-256
  * to secure data in each block &#x20;
  * to maintain the blockchain's immutability
* Peer to Peer Network
  * P2P network to connect nodes(computer) that will participate in the blockchain
  * these nodes will communicate and share the blockchain data
* Consensus Rules
  * e.g: how new transactions are verified and added to the blockchain&#x20;
  * to ensure that all nodes agree on the state of the blockchain
* Genesis Block
  * first block in the blockchain&#x20;
  * often contains initial data or configuration information
* Transaction Structure
  * specify what data can be included
  * ensure a method for creating, signing, & broadcasting transactions
* Security Measures
  * protect against unauthorized access
  * access control
  * encryption
  * key management
* Wallets
  * develop/integrate wallet software to store & manage cryptocurrency assets&#x20;
  * users need wallets to participate in the network
* Block Explorer
  * \[optional]
  * to enable users to explore the blockchain's transaction history & details
* Testing Environment
  * to conduct testing
    * unit tests
    * integration tests
    * network simulations
* Documentation
  * doc on how to interact with the blockchain network
    * APIs&#x20;
    * commands&#x20;
* Community & Governance
  * how to manage the network&#x20;
  * how to involve the community
  * how to make decisions regarding upgrades and changes
