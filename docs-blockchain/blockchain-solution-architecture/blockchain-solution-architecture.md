# 🌹 Blockchain Solution Architecture

## Blockchain Architecture

blockchain — **distributed database** running on thousands of computers globally; stored across multiple nodes with each holding a full copy

* p2p network; a network which is listening & greeting participants
* data can be only added — immutable database

<kbd>**blockchain — chain of blocks**</kbd>

**each block carries**

* transaction data  — set of transactions
* a hash — immutable unless someone has breached the system&#x20;
* a reference to the previous block —  hash of the previous block&#x20;
* timestamp — approximate reasonable time, not exact — used to ensure the chronological order of transactions

{% hint style="warning" %}
In a decentralized network,&#x20;

╰┈➤ there's <mark style="color:$danger;">**no single "source of truth" for time**</mark>

╰┈➤ and **nodes can't perfectly synchronize their clocks**
{% endhint %}

**blockchain transactions**

* state recorded in the database is modified/updated by **transactions**
* say a transaction changes state of 2 variables; when transaction is applied either all changes are applied or none applied&#x20;
* a transaction is cryptographically signed by the sender; who initiated it

**wallets / public addresses**

* **public address**: cryptographic identifier you share with others to receive cryptocurrency or tokens
* **wallet address**: what you provide to someone else to receive funds, acting much like an account number in traditional finance systems
  * it's derived from the wallet's public key and unique for each blockchain
* In practice, a wallet can contain multiple public addresses

**cryptographic hash —  hash relationship**

* core security feature of blockchain&#x20;
* every block contains the hash of the previous block
* links blocks together
* tampering → break chain → cascading effect → alarm tampering
* use hash functions: SHA-256

**consensus — referee**

layers function together

* application layer — DApps running&#x20;
* data layer — blocks&#x20;
* network layer — P2P network, communication & transaction propagation
* protocol layer

**public/private key architecture: asymmetric encryption**

* private keys&#x20;
  * sign transactions
  * ensures transaction integrity, authenticity
* public keys&#x20;
  * receive/send funds&#x20;
  * verify transaction signatures&#x20;

**smart contracts — automated condition-based transactions**

* verifiable & tamper proof by cryptographic means; hashing, encryption

**Merkle Tree**:

* organize large datasets in a hierarchical hash-based structure&#x20;
* efficient data verification within a block, without downloading the whole blockchain

{% hint style="warning" %}
benefits of blockchain; data integrity, security, fault tolerance, failover, redundancy

**come at the expense of speed, performance, and efficiency**
{% endhint %}



#### **blockchain application — 3 primary architectural layers**

* top layer — user interface layer
* middle layer — connect user interface to smart contracts&#x20;
* bottom layer — smart contracts running on the blockchain network

╰┈➤ thus changing the smart contract layer will result in needing to do corresponding changes to middle layer and top layer too&#x20;

&#x20;



## Designing Blockchain Systems

{% hint style="success" %}
**Blockchain’s value isn’t in the data it stores—it’s in the trust it builds.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Blockchain projects without **clear governance** or **realistic goals** have collapsed.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Blockchain isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution.&#x20;

🌹 Blockchain's potential lies in **aligning** the **right use case** with the **right architecture**.

🌹 **Success** depends on understanding the unique challenges of each industry
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Every great blockchain solution starts with a foundation built on&#x20;

* needs,&#x20;
* clarity, and&#x20;
* alignment.

### Data Privacy related Considerations

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Private and Public Blockchains**</mark>

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Encryption**</mark>

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Off-Chain Data**</mark>: sensitive information — stored off-chain | blockchain — record only transaction hashes or proofs of existence

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Zero-Knowledge Proofs**</mark>: enable one party to prove that they possess specific information without revealing the information itself

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Consent and Control**</mark>: interfaces to manage data sharing preferences

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Data Minimization**</mark>: collect and store only the data necessary for the intended purpose

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Regulatory Compliance**</mark>: `GDPR` in EU | `HIPAA` in US

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Immutable Records**</mark>: how to handle incorrect or outdated data

📌 <mark style="color:$primary;">**Smart Contracts**</mark>: to automate data-sharing agreements;  to enforce privacy rules (who has access to what data under what conditions) on the blockchain

### Governance&#x20;

✅ Governances requires vigilance

{% hint style="success" %}
Remember - Obtaining alignment from all solution owners / participants is critical to success!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Role of smart contracts in blockchain governance...

facilitate transparent voting
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
In blockchain, the chain is only as strong as its leaders—and its followers.
{% endhint %}



**Blockchain specific governance concerns**

Decentralization vs. Centralization, handling protocol upgrades and hard/soft forks

Participation and Voter Apathy, Cultural and Ideological Differences

Network Security and Attack Resistance, Security and Consensus Mechanisms

Funding and Sustainability, Evolving Ecosystem, Interoperability

Governance Attacks, Token Holder Influence, Transparency and Accountability

User Experience, Social Dynamics

[daos-decentralized-autonomous-organizations.md](../governance/daos-decentralized-autonomous-organizations.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

#### Implementing Governance Framework

1. establish guiding principles for governance—ethical norms, operational rules, a fallback plan for forks
2. implement smart contract mechanisms to automate critical governance decisions



### Legal Considerations

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Designing a compliant cross-border system — understanding different nations priorities and planning for future changes

* US — prioritizes innovation freedom
* EU — focuses on user protection and data privacy
* UAE's Central Bank — emphasizes financial stability
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Don’t just react — But anticipate

Consider all the legal issues upfront and design with flexibility for the unknown

* Intellectual property and Patents
* Data privacy
* Custody rules
* Regulations: GDPR, AML, KYC
{% endhint %}

* Smart Contract Enforceability
* Cross-Border Legal Issues
* Token Classification
* Consumer Protection
* Taxation
* Fraud and Scams

{% hint style="success" %}
In blockchain, the only constant is uncertainty.&#x20;

**Stay ahead of the rules, or get left behind.**
{% endhint %}

#### Good Practices

✅ modular compliance layers

✅ jurisdiction-specific adjustments

✅ a self-regulatory code of conduct for DeFi operations

## Security Concerns

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### **A chain is only as strong as its weakest link**&#x20;

Don't inherit security vulnerabilities from someone else!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Security Goals: Integrity, Availability, Anonymity

**Prioritize integrity, availability, or anonymity?**

Cannot have it all&#x20;
{% endhint %}

✅ Secure Networks — standard TCP/IP computer network &#x20;

* DDoS — Transaction Flooding
  * squeeze out some legitimate transactions
  * drive up the gas price
  * manipulate the block difficulty on `PoW` networks&#x20;
  * DDoS on Next Block Validator
  * DDoS against Centralized Components — Permissioned Blockchains
    * MSP in Hyperledger
* Eclipse Attacks — isolate node/group of nodes
  * manipulating difficulty levels
  * 51% attacks
  * double-spend with less than 51% control on a `PoW` network
* Replay Attacks — resubmit signed transactions
* Sybil Attacks — fake nodes

✅ Secure Blockchain Protocol

* PoW
  * 51% attack&#x20;
    * double spends
  * selfish mining — withholds newly found blocks
    * used in conjunction with 51% attack — double spends
  * physical attacks — power cuts
    * 51% attacks — double spends
* PoS
  * XX% attack — depends on PoS network configurations
    * double-spends&#x20;
    * `[theory]` protected against by the theory of supply and demand
  * long-range attack — stake bleeding; do nothing on main chain; do not validate blocks when selected
    * double spend — by mining longer divergent chain
  * PoS time-bomb — rich gets richer; higher stake — higher reward
    * higher control over time
    * limiting maximum block reward — easily circumvented
    * slows down the network
  * consensus centralization
  * PoS block forger attacks&#x20;
    * long-range attack
    * block timestamp manipulation

✅ Secure Middle Layer

✅ Secure Smart Contracts

* attacker breaking out of sandboxed environment of smart contract and attacking the host
* smart contract permanence — attackers gain extra information for potential attacks
* reentrancy — re enter functions before first execution completes and drain funds
* front running — submits transactions with a higher priority (fee) while stealing other's answers&#x20;
* integer overflow / underflow — Unsigned integer/numeric variables&#x20;
  * overflow to zero&#x20;
  * underflow to their maximum value
* logic errors
* block gas limit problem — limit on the maximum amount of gas a block allowed to consume
  * larger arrays,  excessive looping&#x20;
  * supports DDoS attacks
* default visibility — smart contract functions are public by default
* timestamp manipulation — deliberately tampers with the timestamps of blocks

✅ secure other solution artifacts&#x20;

* user interface

✅ Secure Client / Client Environment
