# Design Options & Considerations

## Design Options

### ﻿﻿Public vs. Private Blockchain

✅ need to strike the right balance between private and public blockchains&#x20;

* trade-offs: data privacy, control, access
* public blockchains: expose sensitive data to the public
* private blockchains: limited decentralization

### ﻿﻿On-Chain vs Off-Chain Data

* off-chain:&#x20;
  * deletable — correct inaccuracies, delete when customer requests
  * data privacy regulations: GDPR
  * sensitive/personal data&#x20;
* on-chain:
  * immutable



## Design Considerations

### Mashups

seamless communication between different platforms&#x20;

* public & private blockchains — different blockchain platforms
* blockchain and legacy system integration&#x20;
  * legacy: client-server
  * blockchain: peer-to-peer
* on-chain & off-chain solutions



### Scalability

* measurements to consider
  * transaction throughput
  * transaction latency
* do not fall victim to your own success — The `GovernMental` Attack
* transactions/participants increase — slower transaction speed, higher cost



### Economic Model & Incentive Mechanism

* economic model and incentives — must ensure participation and alignment of stakeholders' interests
