## Example: Project **kickoff meeting preparation**

**global logistics company** — a blockchain solution to streamline their operations, improve transparency, and enhance trust

* needs analysis
  * exact problem they want to solve
  * what value do they expect blockchain to bring
* use case identification
  * pain points — lack of audit trails, slow transactions, inefficiencies
* prioritize use cases
  * scorecard based on
    * value delivered
    * development pain
    * problem complexity
    * risk
* design PoC
  * network topology
  * PoC architecture
  * smart contract design
  * PoC should
    * test the consensus mechanism
    * integrate smart contract programming
    * align on key functionality
* stakeholder alignment: **`build alignment up front`**  approach
  * slower at the start&#x20;
  * save time during development by ensuring everyone is on the same page
* outline transition to MVP
* bring in external stakeholders during the transition from PoC to MVP
  * stakeholder feedback refine the solution and ensure buy-in
