**Involve**

* in-depth discussions with stakeholders —  clients, end-users, technical teams
* feasibility studies &#x20;
* assessing the technical, regulatory, operational aspects that impact the project's success

**Helps to**&#x20;

* set clear goals and expectations — establishing a solid foundation for the entire project
* move forward with a well-defined roadmap for the blockchain solution

**@ the end of this phase**

* the development team should have a comprehensive understanding of the project's scope, objectives, and constraints

{% hint style="info" %}
In many cases, **Blockchain** serves **as a foundational layer for** the use of these **other** **emerging** **technologies**.

* AI
* Big Data
* Metaverse
* 5G
{% endhint %}



### Goals of Needs Analysis Phase

<mark style="background-color:green;">**Goal**</mark>:&#x20;

* ✅️ **understand** **blockchain** technology
* ✅️  understand the **potential benefits, risks** to the organization & SWOT analysis
* ✅️ Short, medium, and long-term **non-technical business objectives**
* ✅️ How blockchain will support or enhance these business objectives

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Blockchain is just an option, not a requirement!

✅️ Completing needs analysis and realizing you have no use for blockchain is a **valid outcome**.
{% endhint %}



#### **1️⃣ Review / Define business objectives**&#x20;

* **define/review business objectives; non-technical definitions of our goals**
  * things we want to achieve in a given timeframe
  * think about ways that blockchain technology might be used to help support those objectives
* share them with all the relevant stakeholders

{% hint style="success" %}
#### Good Business Objective

* **`timeless`**: just as valid in the future and the past as it is today
  * getting too focused on the technology aspect will generally remove the timeless aspect
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Do not allow technical capabilities to define business objectives.

Clearly define business objectives beforehand; in the absence of any technical consideration.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Any technology you have on your plan that can not directly or indirectly support business objectives is likely one that isn't going to provide value to the organization.

📌 Consider a workshop session with your stakeholder audience where you focus on 4 questions:

   2. Would the adoption of blockchain or emerging technologies create additional strengths?
2. What are your organizational **weaknesses**?
   1. What are you bad at and what can be improved?&#x20;

3. Do any market **opportunities** exist and can they be capitalized upon using blockchain or blockchain and Web3 technologies?
4. What market **threats** exist in the marketplace that could potentially be mitigated or offset by adopting blockchain, Web3, or other emerging technologies?

* consider interviews with&#x20;
  * your senior leadership team

  * leadership representatives from all your major departments, divisions, offices, or geographies

In these interviews, you should be focused on gauging the relative level of understanding in 3 critical areas:

   * What are the critical business processes that must be executed?

   * Is there room to make changes, adjustments, or tweaks?
2. Ensure you and your stakeholder team have arrived at a solid understanding of the **alignment between technology objectives and business objectives**.
   * How can blockchain / Web3 technology support your business objectives?
   * ﻿﻿If your business objectives are properly defined, this should be simple.
3. Ensure you are finding ways to **measure** **insight**, **visibility**, and **communications** **around** each **process**.
   * Who has insight and visibility into this particular process and can give us information and report on its execution?
   * What are the metrics collected for this process and how is it measured?
   * What process changes and updates are required and how are they communicated across the organization and across our larger business network?

{% endhint %}



#### 7️⃣ Go-Forward planning

realize&#x20;

    * demonstrating a strong alignment for business objectives&#x20;
    * point to the potential positive impact the adoption may have in the customer experience
