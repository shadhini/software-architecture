# Use Case Identification

## Use Case Identification

> **identify and scorecard potential use cases**
>
> * examine & define potential applications and scenarios where blockchain can add value to determine the technology's most suitable and beneficial use cases



﻿﻿**Identify use cases**

* where blockchain can provide value
  * e.g: enhancing transparency in supply chain management, reducing fraud in financial transactions, streamlining healthcare data exchange
* project stakeholders collaborate —  business analysts, technical experts, end-users
* thorough examination of the organization's&#x20;
  * pain points
  * inefficiencies&#x20;
  * areas where blockchain's inherent characteristics-such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency-can offer substantial benefits
* evaluate use cases carefully in terms of their&#x20;
  * feasibility
  * relevance&#x20;
  * alignment with the organization's strategic objectives



#### **Key Deliverables for Organizations at this Step Completion**

**🎯 One or more prioritized initial use case ideas**

* Each use case must align with one or more business objectives from Needs Analysis&#x20;
* Stakeholders will be able to explain why each use case is significant
* ﻿﻿Stakeholder team will clearly understand what they want to achieve and how technology will support their goals

🎯 **Definition of functional requirements for a Proof of Concept**

* ﻿﻿Focus on the what, not the how....
  * Stakeholder team will define what needs to be built, but will not worry about or focus on how it will be built



#### Expanding Stakeholder Team Membership

* ﻿﻿**Business Analysts**: provides insight on how selected use cases might impact the business
* ﻿﻿**Product Engineers**: provides input on how selected use cases align with current and future product\
  catalog & overall feature set
* ﻿﻿**Technical Architects**: provides input and guidance on technical considerations, feasibility, and complexity of solutioning proposed use cases
* ﻿﻿**Solution Administrators**: provides feedback on the cost of supporting PoCs and potential MVPs around selected use cases



#### Considerations of Stakeholder Team in this Phase

* What potential **use cases** exist in the world around me?
  * How does each one **align with** short-term / medium-term / long-term **business**\
    **objectives**?
* How do I evaluate and **prioritize** potential **use** **cases**?
* How do I **translate** **business** **requirements** **into** **functional** requirements so l can architect a blockchain **proof-of-concept**?
* Whether blockchain can improve trust and security, streamline processes, and reduce operational costs ?



#### Tasks

* ﻿﻿**Identify** and document potential **use cases**
* ﻿﻿**Prioritize** use case development
* ﻿﻿Define and document solution parameters
* ﻿﻿Gather and document high-level solution requirements down the functional level
  * ﻿﻿Define & Document **Personas**
  * ﻿﻿Define & Document **User Stories** based on Personas
  * ﻿﻿Define & Document **Functional Requirements** extracted from User Stories
* ﻿﻿Defining and documenting platform and **technology choices**
* ﻿﻿Define and document **technical solution architecture**
  * ﻿﻿Define & Document **Technical Requirements** based on Functional Requirements
* ﻿﻿Develop **Product Backlog**&#x20;
  * ﻿﻿Develop **tasks**, **project schedule**, and **sprint plans** from Technical Requirements
