>
> * maintained by the product owner
> * dynamic list
> * typically used in agile frameworks like Scrum



* What are the prioritized Functional Requirements?
* Which functions should be implemented in which order?
* The **priority** should be **decided** **by** **non-technical stakeholder audience**!
