# Justify a Technical Solution

## Justify a Technical Solution

{% hint style="info" %}
Taking time to find this justification helps to avoid the mistake of implementing technology for technology's sake.
{% endhint %}

* Can you tell **a story about a demonstrable impact to the customer experience**?
  * How does the use of a particular technology make things better (or different) for our customers?
  * ✓⃝ If the **customer experience** is **improved**, very often you've justified your solution!&#x20;
* Is there **business** **value to this technology beyond the customer experience**?
  * Example: A solution which reduces employee turnover may not affect the customer experience, but would still be valuable



#### Things that don't justify a technical solution

* **`FOMO`**: ﻿﻿Fear Of Missing Out
  * ﻿﻿Don't do it just because everyone else is....
* **Value** that **cannot** **be** **directly** **tied** back **to a business objective**
  * ﻿﻿business objectives should drive technology objectives
  * ﻿﻿❗DO NOT REVERSE THIS!
* "**`Because blockchain!`**"
  * ﻿﻿Don't use a technology because it "seems" like the right answer
  * ﻿﻿"Everyone else is doing it" isn't a good answer either
* "**`Databases are dead!`**"
  * ﻿﻿Blockchain is a tool
  * ﻿﻿Tools don't replace other tools
