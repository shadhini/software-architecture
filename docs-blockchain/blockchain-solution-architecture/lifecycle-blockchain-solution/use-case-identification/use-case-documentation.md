# Use Case Documentation

## Define & Document Solution Parameters&#x20;

Obtain <mark style="color:blue;">alignment from the stakeholder team</mark> on the following items:

* Who is the **intended user base / audience** for this solution?
* What **problem** is the proposed solution aiming to solve?
* **How** will **it solve** that problem?
* Will the solution **introduce** any **new problems / concerns**?
* What will the **solution** **do**? — boundaries&#x20;
* What will the **solution not do**?
* What is the **expected lifespan** of this solution?



## Define & Document Personas&#x20;

> **`Personas`**:
>
> the types of users (or roles) who will use your solution



✅️ **good persona description**&#x20;

* 1-2 paragraphs at the most
* describes the current state of things
  * what things are like today for the user or role being described
    * steps & processes that must be followed to do this role's job/task
* discuss&#x20;
  * current pain points,
  * how they make users feel, and&#x20;
  * their impact on the user's ability to do their job or task



## Define & Document User Stories based on Personas

> **User Story**:
>
> * each user story is a short description (1-2 paragraphs) of **a user using the idealized fictional solution**
> * should describe&#x20;
>   * the **desired interactions** and&#x20;
>   * **expected outcomes** users will have with the solution

**story about user using the idealized fictional solution**

* What if the "perfect" solution could be created out of thin air? What would it look like?
* At this point, don't be worried about constraints like cost, technical complexity, or feasibility
* Simply imagine the perfect solution and describe it



## Define & Document Functional Requirements extracted from User Stories

* ﻿﻿Each User Story will be broken down into a series of bullet points
  * These bullet points will outline what the solution needs to do
  * Create a bullet point for each thing the solution was doing in your User Story
* ﻿﻿Define **everything the solution should do**, worry about how to do it later



## Define & Document Platform and Technology Choices

Which platforms, technologies, languages, and toolsets are being considered?

* ﻿﻿What benefits / drawbacks does each option bring?
* ﻿﻿Which option have we selected?
  * ﻿﻿Can this decision be revisited in the future? If so, how?
* ﻿﻿Does this component require technical / non-technical training or education?



## Define & Document Technical Solution Architecture

@this phase, technical team gets takes over requirement definition



﻿﻿Technical Requirements **explain** **how a Functional Requirement will be fulfilled**

* ﻿﻿each Functional Requirement should be broken down into one or more bullet points explaining how that Functional Requirement will be fulfilled



**Technical Requirements will define Tasks**

* ﻿﻿**`Tasks`**: the explicit **steps** (**in order)** that must be taken to fulfill a Technical Requirement
* each Task should be assigned an **estimated number of hours** to complete as well as a description of the **resource(s) needed** (e.g: skillset) to complete it

{% hint style="info" %}
In general, if a task cannot be estimated or skillset can not be identified, the task needs to further **broken down into sub-tasks**.
{% endhint %}
