{% hint style="warning" %}
Cryptocurrencies offer growing benefits and adoption but face significant challenges that limit mainstream use, so weigh pros vs cons before using as investment or everyday currency.
{% endhint %}

#### Market risk

* Volatility: rapid and unpredictable change in price&#x20;
  * extreme price swings
  * examples: `Bitcoin`, `Ether`, `Dogecoin`
* Market manipulation: large-holder influence — have the ability to significantly influence prices, low liquidity[^1]
* perception of cryptocurrencies as investment assets rather than currency: speculative demand → instability
* Poor store-of-value suitability: not stable stores of value
* Hindrance to everyday use





#### Regulatory & legal

* Regulatory uncertainty
  * varies greatly by jurisdiction
  * unclear compliance requirements
  * evolving rules
* Regulatory changes: shifting legality / usage impacts (in everyday scenarios)
* Illegal activity / reputation risk
  * money laundering concerns
  * regulatory scrutiny
* Legal & taxes: complex, varying tax compliance



#### Adoption & access

* Limited merchant acceptance — as a form of payment: few brick‑and‑mortar[^2] sellers
* Limited everyday adoption for everyday purchases
  * groceries, fuel, essentials rarely supported
* User adoption challenges:&#x20;
  * unfamiliarity, skepticism
  * steep learning curve&#x20;
* Technological barriers: device/internet access, digital divide



#### Scalability & performance

* Throughput limits / low TPS
* Slow confirmations in transaction settlement  under load
* High transaction fees during congestion



#### Upgrades & interoperability

* Hard forks & network upgrades impact (negative impact to adoption)
* Lack of interoperability: multiple chains, limited cross-chain flow
  * hinder seamless transactions between different cryptocurrencies &#x20;
  * reduce their utility



#### Security & custody

* Network & ecosystem attacks
  * hacks, phishing, other cybersecurity vulnerabilities
* Private key loss
  * lost/stolen keys → permanent loss of funds



#### Privacy & anonymity

* Public ledger transparency → deanonymization risk
* Partial anonymity only; transaction traceability



#### UX, user responsibility & error

* Wallet management complexity
* Private-key & transaction handling: best-practice required
* User error & responsibility: permanent transactions → high user burden
* Steep learning curve for non-technical users



#### Consumer protections & recourse[^3]

* Irreversible transactions
  * mistakes cannot be undone
    * recovering lost or misallocated funds is likely impossible
    * no customer support you can call
* Limited consumer safeguards
  * no deposit insurance
  * no chargeback options
  * minimal centralized customer support
*   Limited customer support / dispute resolution options



#### Environmental impact

* High energy consumption (notably PoW)
* Negative environmental perception
