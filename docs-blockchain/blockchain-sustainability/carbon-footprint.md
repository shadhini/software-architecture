# Carbon Footprint

## Carbon Footprint

> **Energy Metrics: Key Aspects**
>
> * Proof of Stake consumes significantly less energy than Proof of Work&#x20;
>   * → **PoS more environmentally friendly**
> * **geographic location** of mining centers significantly impacts their carbon footprint
>   * centers relying on **fossil fuel-based** energy sources — tend to have higher energy impact
>   * centers situated in regions with access to **renewable energy** sources (e.g: hydroelectric power) — exhibits lower carbon footprint
> * Using **renewable energy sources for blockchain operations** — reduces environmental impact of energy consumption; mitigate carbon emissions; aligns blockchain technology with sustainability and eco-friendly practices

#### Key stats (Aug 2023)

* Annual energy consumption estimates
  * Bitcoin energy: 150.97 TWh&#x20;
    * ≈ total consumption of all televisions and refrigerators in the US
  * Ethereum energy: 5.89 GWh (≈ 0.004% of Bitcoin)
* Bitcoin > energy of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, Google combined
* Ledger sizes
  * Bitcoin ledger: 475 GB
    * 300,000 miners storing this data → 475GB x 300,000 miners = 142,500 TB of data
  * Ethereum ledger: 1,156 GB
* NFT minting (a single NFT): carbon ≈ 500-mile road trip
*   Fossil fuels power ≈ 60% of Bitcoin mining

#### Energy sources & mining

* Enormous electricity consumption (PoW)
* Majority from non‑renewable sources →  environmental sustainability concerns
* Much mining in low‑regulation countries



#### Inefficiency & trade-offs

* Blockchain = intentionally inefficient
* Benefits derived from inefficiency (security, decentralization)
*   Centralized solutions always more efficient

    * No redundant data
    * No consensus activities
    * No heavy data sync
    * No strong cryptographic signatures



#### Storage impact

* Large ledger footprint per node
* Question: ledger data worth the cost long‑term?
* Exploration: off‑load historical data + keep cryptographic proofs on the ledger



#### Centralization & externalities

* Energy consumption → centralization (cheap electricity hubs, mining farms, economies of scale)
* Perceived exclusivity: access & participation favors those with cheap energy
* Negative externality: environmental costs borne by all; benefits by crypto holders



#### Smart contracts, dApps & validators

* Energy‑intensive smart contracts (complex calcs, frequent updates)
* Un‑optimized contracts → unnecessary compute on many nodes
  * smart contract code is likely executed on most or all of the network nodes individually
* dApps (resource-intensive operations — gaming, large data) → additional resource implications
* PoS networks: validators consume electricity (lower than PoW but non‑zero)



#### Infrastructure & hardware impacts

* Mining hardware production: raw material extraction, manufacturing, transport → resource consumption & environmental impact
* Blockchain node data centers: substantial energy for cooling + operation
* Pressure on renewable energy sources: increased demand may affect availability/pricing for other sectors



#### Scalability & long‑term risks

* Energy use can increase with scaling (users, transactions)
* Many projects prioritize short‑term dev over long‑term sustainability planning
* Storage & energy sustainability concerns as networks grow



#### Standards & coding practices

* Lack of universal standards for measuring/reporting environmental impact
* Defining universal standards hard on decentralized, open‑source tech
* Inefficient coding practices exacerbate energy use (smart contracts executed across nodes)
