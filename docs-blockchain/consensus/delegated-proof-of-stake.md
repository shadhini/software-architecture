# Delegated Proof of Stake

## Delegated Proof of Stake

* designed as a lightweight version of PoS
* similar to true democracy vs representative democracy
  * true democracy:&#x20;
    * every citizen gets to cast a vote on every single decision being made
    * provides the maximum amount of representation and fairness
    * very inefficient approach&#x20;
  * representative democracy:&#x20;
    * citizens vote on representatives who will cast votes on their behalf



> **Delegated Proof of Stake**:
>
> * "**`Delegates`**" are elected to **represent** coin holders
> * **Coin holders** can **vote** for delegates using their staked funds
> * **Delegates** with the most votes are selected to **create the next block**
>
>
>
> * **Number** of **delegates** is usually **fixed** by the protocol
>   * can be adjusted periodically by network owner



## Benefits & Concerns of Delegated PoS compared to PoS

* Increase in efficiency and performance over PoS
  * since there is much smaller number of representative nodes participating in the actual consensus process&#x20;
  * just like a democratic society, electing representatives makes things move along a lot quicker and more efficiently while still retaining many of the basic characteristics of a true democracy
* Introduces a greater level of centralization, which may not be desirable
* Concerns around scheming and collusion are enhanced
  * anytime we take a delegated approach, we put a disproportionate amount of power and control in the hands of the delegates
  * this can make those delegates ripe targets for any type of collusion, scheming, or flat out attack
