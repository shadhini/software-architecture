# Proof of Authority

## `PoA`: Proof of Authority

> **Proof of Authority**:
>
> * **validators** are **identified**, **known** & **approved** **ahead** of time
>   * only accepted validators are allowed to participate in consensus activities
> * relies on the reputation of validators



* **smaller** number of **validators** = **greater** **performance**
* in theory, **known validators** results in **fewer attacks**&#x20;
  * less incentive to attack when identity is known
* often **used in consortium situations** where participants already know each other&#x20;
  * this simplifies validator selection and reduces some of the unique concerns (around scheming /collusion) PoA introduces&#x20;
* introduces **greater centralization**
  * requires greater trust in network owners & administrator
