# Proof of Space

## Proof of Space

> **Proof of Space:**
>
> * **Rewards** users who reserve **disk space** or storage space for the ledger
> * Uses the concept of **Rainbow Tables**
>   * each **node** allocates some amount of **space to store answers** for some questions from a larger pool of questions
> * **First node** to demonstrate it **has the answer** to a **randomly** selected **question** gets to validate the block



### How it Works

Rainbow Tables scheme&#x20;

* we have large **pool of questions**
* **every node** on the network gets to decide how much **space** they want to allocate **to** their **rainbow table**&#x20;
* that rainbow table **contains answers** to some of the **questions** in that larger question pool

When it's time to validate a block, the **protocol** will **randomly select** one of these **questions**

* the **first node** on the network that can demonstrate they have the **correct answer** to that question in their rainbow table will be the node that gets to **validate the block**
