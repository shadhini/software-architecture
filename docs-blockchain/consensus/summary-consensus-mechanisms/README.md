# Summary: Consensus Mechanisms

## Consensus Mechanisms

Byzantine Generals Problem — consensus in a trustless environment

* PoW: Proof of Work
  * guessing game — solving a mathematically difficult problem
  * main drawback: high energy consumption
* PoS: Proof of Stake
  * waging
  * true democracy: every node participate in next block creation
  * almost no concerns around 51% attack
  * concerns: efficiency
* Delegated PoS:
  * representative democracy: only representatives selected from a voting participate in next block creation
  * more efficiency & performance than PoS
  * higher level of centralization
  * concerns: scheming and collusion





{% hint style="danger" %}
#### Security Concerns (Potential Risks and Attack Vectors) around different Consensus Mechanisms are different.

❗Users moving solutions from one type of network to another should be aware of the potential risks and new attack vectors.



E.g: PoS opens different attack vectors than PoW

* PoS removes concerns around a 51% attack
* but PoS introduce Block Validator/Block Forger attack

Group consensus mechanisms : proof of space, proof of activity

participant consensus model that is commonly found on permissioned blockchains
