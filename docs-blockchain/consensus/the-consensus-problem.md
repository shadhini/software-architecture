# The Consensus Problem

## The Consensus Problem

* Most blockchains run on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks
  * every node/computer on the network is equally privileged
  * no leader — no node is in a position to dictate what another should or should not do
  * how can a network of equal peers reach a decision state with no leader or authority to dictate their actions and outcomes ?

#### Let the protocol be the leader!

If there's no "leader to make decisions, how are decisions made ?

╰┈➤ ANSWER: Let the protocol be the leader!

* In a **client-server network**, the server is the leader; the authoritative resource
* On a **peer-to-peer network** centralized authority is implemented at the protocol level, rather than at the network architecture level.
