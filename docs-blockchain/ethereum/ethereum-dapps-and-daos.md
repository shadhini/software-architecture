# Ethereum DApps and DAOs

## Ethereum DApps and DAOs

[#dapp-vs-dao](../blockchain-architecture/dapps-decentralized-applications.md#dapp-vs-dao "mention")

#### `DApp`: Ethereum Decentralized Application

* avoid single point of failure — not governed by central server
* uses Ethereum as development platform
* there's no master copy of DApp



Examples:

`WeiFund`, `Storj.io`, `KYC-Chain`, `4G Capital`&#x20;



#### `DAO`: Decentralized Autonomous Organization

* designed to hold assets and use the voting system to distribute them
* DAOs exist entirely on Blockchain and are governed by the consensus protocols
