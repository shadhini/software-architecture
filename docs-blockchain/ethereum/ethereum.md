# Ethereum

## Ethereum

> — an **open**, **public**, **decentralized** **blockchain** **network** and **open-source** **software development platform**  —&#x20;
>
> * powered by the cryptocurrency **ether** (`ETH`)
> * built on `Bitcoin` that let you send and receive digital cash (without a bank) with **open-source programs** called **smart contracts**

home to thousands of&#x20;

* cryptocurrencies &#x20;
* **DeFi**: dapps for decentralized finance
* **NFTs**: non-fungible tokens
* governance tokens
* dapps for gaming &#x20;
* dapps for decentralized social media &#x20;
* dapps for art and collectibles
* **stablecoins**

{% hint style="success" %}
Collectively, this **ecosystem** is called "**web3**", representing the third phase of the **internet centered around ownership**.
{% endhint %}

#### Smart Contracts&#x20;

* let anyone create their own digital assets and decentralized applications (dapps) that run 24/7, globally
* available to anyone with an internet connection



#### Ethereum Network <a href="#network" id="network"></a>

> **a global digital infrastructure that anyone can use** but nobody can abuse
>
> * made up of **thousands of independent computers** around the world called nodes run by regular people
> * nodes work together to provide financial services and digital applications to anyone, anywhere



#### Ethereum Mainnet

> The **Ethereum network millions use every day**, where real assets are exchanged and real apps live.&#x20;

* “**Mainnet**” helps to distinguish it from&#x20;
  * Ethereum layer 2 networks, and&#x20;
  * test networks (testnets) which developers use to try out new features before going live.



#### Ethereum Network Fees (aka Gas Fees) <a href="#network-fees" id="network-fees"></a>

> **Every transaction** on Ethereum costs a small fee called a **gas fee**.

Gas Fee

* a part of it is **paid to the validator** who adds your transaction to a “block” of transactions
* another part gets **“burned”, removing it from the supply**



<mark style="color:$success;">**Importance of Gas Fee**</mark>

✅ Keeps Ethereum **sybil-resistant** by preventing malicious actors from overwhelming the network with fraudulent activities

✅ Because computation costs gas, **spamming** Ethereum with expensive transactions, either accidentally and maliciously, is **financially disincentivized**.

✅ A **hard-limit** on the amount of computation that can be done at any one time prevents Ethereum from being overwhelmed, helping to ensure the **network is always accessible**.



**when the network is busy, fees go up** — when things are quieter, fees go down

╰┈➤ helps balance supply and demand&#x20;



**fees vary depending on what you're doing** — The more complex the transaction the more gas it costs



#### Consensus Mechanism

> **Proof of Stake — PoS**

* people/validators lock up some ETH — put their ETH at stake, as a deposit so that they can help **secure the network**
* when you stake ETH, your validator gets chosen to check and add new transactions
* if you do it honestly, you **earn rewards**
* if you **try to cheat, you lose part of your stake**



to attack the network, **an entity needs at least 1/3 of all staked ETH to begin attacking the network**

* more than 1/2 changes which version is considered truth&#x20;
* more than 2/3 would allow finalizing something the rest don't agree with
