# How to use Ethereum Network

## General Public

* use the network via a **digital wallet**
  * **wallet** — a web or mobile app that lets you **send** and **receive ETH, manage your assets**, and use apps



## Developers and Businesses&#x20;

— Developers and Businesses building on Ethereum —&#x20;

* use APIs
* use node software
* deploy smart contracts
* use L2 networks for lower fees, faster speeds



## How can you help to secure the Ethereum network ?&#x20;

1. **Running a Node**
   * Nodes store the entire history of the blockchain, including all transactions and smart contract data.&#x20;
   * By syncing with other nodes, they can agree on the state of the network, making sure transactions are legit and smart contract data is available.

2.  **Staking your ETH**

    * The easiest way is through a staking provider like [Lido](https://lido.fi/ethereum) or [Rocketpool](https://rocketpool.net/)
    * but if you have the know-how, try running validator software at home
    * Options:&#x20;
      * home staking
      * staking as a service
      * pooled staking
      * centralized exchanges

## What Happens in Ethereum Network

#### When you send $10 in `stablecoins` to a friend on Ethereum:

1. You open your wallet, add the account address and the amount, then click send.
2. Your wallet signs the payment and broadcasts it to the network.
3. The payment waits in the public queue (`mempool`) until a block proposer picks it.
4. The block proposer adds it to the next block of transactions, broadcasts it, and earns a fee.
5. The `stablecoin` contract moves $10 from you to your friend, and both wallets update.
6. A global network of validators double-check and attest to the validity of the changes.

#### When you mint a $5 `collectible` on Ethereum:

1. You connect your wallet to the dapp and choose the item to mint.
2. You confirm the purchase; the wallet signs and broadcasts the transaction.
3. The mint request joins the `mempool` and is added to a block by a validator.
4. The NFT smart contract records your wallet as the new owner.
5. Your new collectible appears in your wallet a few seconds later.
