  * The individuals involved are anonymous, but the contact is made through a public ledger
* A trigger event like an expiration date or a strike price is hit, and the contract executes itself according to the coded terms
* Regulators can use the Blockchain to understand the activities in the market while maintaining the privacy of an individual’s position
