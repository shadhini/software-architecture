{% endhint %}



## Governance Models

#### Consortium Model

<mark style="color:$success;">**Consortium Model**</mark>

* for private blockhains
* put decision-making power in the hands of a selected group of organizations
* too centralized for a public-facing system



#### DAO Model

<mark style="color:$success;">**DAO**</mark>&#x20;

* for public blockchains
* democratic decision-making
* but decision paralysis — debates
* forks&#x20;
  * main governance concern: decision making about which fork to support
  * bring resource allocation challenges and reputational damage

**DAO Governance Models**

* token-based governance model — most popular



#### Hybrid Governance Model

* hybrid approach
  * enough decentralization for transparency
  * but with defined leaders to break stalemates



## Implementing a Governance Framework

{% hint style="success" %}
In blockchain, the chain is only as strong as its leaders—and its followers.
{% endhint %}

1. establish guiding principles for governance—ethical norms, operational rules, a fallback plan for forks
2. implement smart contract mechanisms to automate critical governance decisions
