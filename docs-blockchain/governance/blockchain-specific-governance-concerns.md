# Blockchain-Specific Governance Concerns

## Blockchain-Specific Governance Concerns

{% hint style="success" %}
Remember - Obtaining alignment from all solution owners / participants is critical to success!
{% endhint %}



#### Decentralization vs. Centralization

✅ striking right balance between decentralization & centralized governance&#x20;

* too much centralization → control by a few entities
* excessive decentralization → inefficiencies, lack of accountability

#### Protocol Upgrades and Hard/Soft Forks

deciding on protocol upgrades & handling forks → disagreements among stakeholders

* ﻿﻿✅ have a agreed upon plan in place to handle soft/hard forks — <mark style="background-color:blue;">fire-drill idea</mark>
* ﻿﻿✅ governance mechanisms need to accommodate differing opinions while ensuring network stability — make everyone feel like they have a say in governance processes while still ensuring we are delivering a safe, secure, reliable solutions

#### Token Holder Influence

many blockchain solutions involve token holders in decision-making processes&#x20;

* large token holders can disproportionately influence decisions → centralization of power&#x20;

#### Participation and Voter Apathy

* ﻿﻿engaging the community in governance decisions — challenging
* low participation rates → decisions that do not represent the best interests of the entire user base

#### Cultural and Ideological Differences

* different stakeholders — varying cultural, ideological, philosophical beliefs → disagreements about the direction of the project
* ✅ make sure to talk through these non-technical differences before you begin your technical work

#### Network Security and Attack Resistance

* governance decisions that impact network security need careful consideration & open dialogue to avoid opening up any potential vulnerabilities/enabling any potential attack vectors

#### Funding and Sustainability

maintaining and developing a blockchain application —  requires financial resources

* ✅ establish a **sustainable funding model** that&#x20;
  * aligns with the project's goals&#x20;
  * while avoiding centralization of control&#x20;

#### Security and Consensus Mechanisms

* ✅ select and maintain a secure consensus mechanism&#x20;
* decisions on switching consensus algorithms or addressing security vulnerabilities must be made collectively

#### Governance Attacks

malicious actors — attempt to manipulate governance processes&#x20;

* ✅ prevent governance attacks&#x20;
* ✅ ensure the legitimacy of voting outcomes&#x20;

#### Transparency and Accountability

key to building trust in the network

* ✅ maintain transparency in decision-making&#x20;
* ✅ hold governance participants accountable for their actions &#x20;

#### Evolving Ecosystem

as the blockchain ecosystem evolves → new challenges & opportunities &#x20;

* ✅ the governance model should be adaptable to changing circumstances and technologies

#### User Experience

* complex governance processes → deter users from participating
* ✅ design user-friendly interfaces & mechanisms&#x20;

#### Social Dynamics

* ﻿﻿The governance of blockchain applications can be influenced by&#x20;
  * social dynamics, power imbalances, community sentiment
* ﻿﻿✅ manage conflicts & foster collaboration&#x20;

#### Interoperability

if the blockchain application interacts with other networks → interoperability concerns

* ❗governance decisions on cross-chain interactions and standards can impact the application's functionality
* ﻿﻿✅ agreed upon decisions how to handle cross-chain/external interactions & pre conditions that needs to be met&#x20;
