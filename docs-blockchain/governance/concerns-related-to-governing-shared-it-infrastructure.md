# Governing Shared IT Infrastructure

## Governing Shared IT Infrastructure

> <mark style="background-color:$primary;">oftentimes blockchain solutions are</mark> <mark style="background-color:$primary;"></mark><mark style="background-color:$primary;">**shared between participants/organizations**</mark>
>
> decentralized solutions require that traditional governance concerns are addressed by **ALL** **participants** **IN ALIGNMENT** with one another!

* traditional solution governance models — a centralized architecture with a single owner



#### Have ALL the owners & stakeholders of the decentralized solution agreed on how to manage the following items....

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### **A chain is only as strong as its weakest link** ...

Don't inherit security vulnerabilities from someone else!
{% endhint %}



* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Security and Data Privacy**</mark>
  * poor governance → data breaches, loss of intellectual property, legal consequences
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Cybersecurity Threats**</mark>
  * inadequate governance →  IT infrastructure vulnerable to cyberattacks
    * malware
    * ransomware
    * phishing&#x20;
    * denial-of-service attacks
  * ✅ threat mitigation processes been standardized by all solution participants
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Access Control**</mark>
  * improper access controls → unauthorized users gaining access to critical systems & sensitive data → data breaches or misuse
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Compliance and Regulatory Requirements**</mark>
  * poor governance → non-compliance → fines & reputational damage
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Change Management**</mark>
  * poorly managed changes to IT infrastructure → system downtime, data loss, security vulnerabilities
  * ✅ changes should be well-documented, tested, and controlled
    * change management process should be well coordinated between participants and compatible with each other's processes
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Asset Management**</mark>
  * inadequate tracking & management of IT assets  →  inefficiencies, unnecessary expenses, difficulties in maintaining a secure and updated infrastructure
  * ✅ coordinate activities asset management activities & execute often&#x20;
    * checking for new releases, issuing patches, performing business continuity & disaster recovery activities&#x20;
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Capacity Planning**</mark>
  * without proper governance  →  organizations may struggle to forecast and allocate resources effectively  →  underutilized resources or performance issues
  * ✅ an agreed upon unified plan in place to deal with increase of popularity/scale
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity**</mark>
  * lack of governance around disaster recovery planning  →  leave organizations vulnerable to data loss & extended downtime in the event of a disaster
  * ✅ make sure DR plans of all participants works in continuity with each other
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Shadow IT**</mark>
  * employees adopting unauthorized or unapproved IT solutions  →  security vulnerabilities & difficulties in managing the solution environment
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Legacy System Management**</mark>
  * ✅ organizations must govern the **maintenance** and **eventual retirement** of legacy systems to avoid security vulnerabilities and integration challenges
  * Do any of these legacy systems integrate with your blockchain solution?
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**User Training and Awareness**</mark>
  * inadequate user training and awareness programs → security breaches caused by human error or lack of understanding of security best practices
    * especially true when it comes to **wallet / private key management**!
  * ✅ make sure to take this into consideration and you've documented steps to alleviate this concern in the governance plan
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Audit and Compliance Reporting**</mark>
  * establishing proper governance → ensures that audit trails & compliance reports are maintained →  facilitate transparency & accountability
  * ✅ define who is responsible for reporting on what
  * ✅ validate that everyone who's supposed to be reporting on things i reporting on those things in an accurate, reliable & timely fashion
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Business Alignment**</mark>
  * ❗are there existing or potential conflicts in the short, medium, and long-term non-technical business objectives between solution participants?
  * ✅ do not let technical capability drive business objectives
  * ✅ define business objectives outside of any technologies/capabilities
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Resource Allocation**</mark>
  * ✅ ﻿﻿agree on which solution participants will be responsible for allocating which critical resources
    * who: developers | administrators | customer support staff | QA engineers&#x20;
    * ﻿﻿are these allocation responsibilities static or dynamic?
      * If dynamic - how, when, and why do they change?
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Documentation and Documentation Management**</mark>
  * poor documentation practices → confusion, difficulties in troubleshooting, challenges in knowledge transfer
  * ✅ agree on who is responsible for documentation of which solution components and processes
  * ✅ have regular content review processes to make sure documentation still aligns with the solution & it still provides value to end users
* <mark style="color:$primary;">**Performance Monitoring and Optimization**</mark>
  * proper governance frameworks → help monitor and optimize IT infrastructure performance to ensure it meets the organization's needs
  * ✅ agree on how will performance be measured, adjusted, optimized, and reported on
