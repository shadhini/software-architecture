# DAOs: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

## `DAO`s: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations

* "**`decentralized`**": stakeholders making key decisions are located all around the world with various different interests, backgrounds, areas of focus
* "**`autonomous`**": a DAO's actions are determined by code and pre-established protocols rather than by human decisions
  * managing the decentralized organization is as autonomous as possible

## History of the Idea "`DAO`"s

{% hint style="info" %}
DAOs date back to the early days of blockchain and cryptocurrency.

The concept of a DAO has evolved over time.
{% endhint %}



`2008-2009`: Satoshi Nakamoto's Vision — Bitcoin whitepaper

* ﻿﻿While Bitcoin itself is not a full-fledged DAO, it introduced the idea of decentralized governance and decision-making through a consensus mechanism\
  (Proof of Work)

`2016`: **`The DAO`**&#x20;

* "﻿﻿`The DAO`": decentralized investment fund built on the `Ethereum` blockchain
* ﻿﻿it allowed participants to invest `Ether` with `DAO` smart contracts who would then take that `Ether` and invest that in other opportunities trying to maximize the return&#x20;
  * participants invested `Ether`  received `DAO` tokens, which represented their stake in the organization
* aimed to use collective decision-making to fund projects and investments

`2016-2020`: Experimentation and Development

* various blockchain projects and communities started experimenting with different governance models and decentralized decision-making mechanisms
* Projects: `Aragon`, `DAOstack`, `MolochDAO` — each offered different approaches to DAO governance and functionality&#x20;

#### `2020-Present`: `DeFi` and Token-Based Governance&#x20;

* ﻿﻿The rise of **`DeFi`**: decentralized finance platforms further popularized the concept of DAOs
  * ﻿﻿Many **DeFi protocols** adopted **token-based governance models**&#x20;
    * allow token holders to vote on proposals, protocol upgrades, and other decisions&#x20;
    * the more governance tokens one hold, the more their vote counts when making decisions
* ﻿﻿<mark style="color:$success;">**Governance tokens**</mark> became **a way for users to participate in the decision-making process of these platforms**

#### `2020-Present`: Modern Use Cases and Experimentation&#x20;

* ﻿﻿The concept of DAOs expanded beyond financial applications
  * ﻿﻿DAOs have been used for&#x20;
    * funding open-source projects
    * managing NFT marketplaces
    * coordinating community initiatives&#x20;
    * more ..&#x20;



## Key Characteristics of "`DAO`"s

**Decentralization**

**Smart Contracts**

* DAOs are typically governed by smart contracts
* smart contracts — ensure that decisions and actions are executed as programmed, without the need for intermediaries

**Decision-Making**

* DAOs enable **decentralized decision-making** through **voting mechanisms**&#x20;
* Token holders or participants can vote on&#x20;
  * proposals
  * protocol upgrades
  * introduction of new features
  * sunsetting of old features&#x20;
  * other governance matters
* Votes are recorded on the blockchain and executed automatically based on **predefined rules**

**Transparency**

* The actions/decisions and transactions within a DAO are transparent and recorded on the blockchain
* Anyone can audit the code, proposals, and voting records, enhancing accountability and trust

\
**Autonomy**

* A DAO operates autonomously - it can execute without direct human intervention once the initial rules and smart contracts are established

\
**Open Participation**

* DAOs are designed to allow open participation, where anyone with the relevant tokens can contribute, propose changes, and vote on decisions

{% hint style="info" %}
Idea behind DAO — diversity is strength

* the more different people/ more different opinions involve → the better governance decisions we can make&#x20;
{% endhint %}



## Challenges & Potential Risks of "`DAO`"s

**Code Vulnerabilities**

* bugs/vulnerabilities in smart contracts → loss of funds or control

**Complex Decision-Making**

* require coordination among diverse stakeholders

**Regulatory Uncertainty**

* legal and regulatory status of DAOs can vary by jurisdiction → potential legal challenges

**Sybil Attacks**

* malicious actors could attempt to manipulate voting systems by creating multiple fake identities&#x20;

**Scalability**

* as the number of participants and transactions grows → scalability issues

**Governance Conflicts**

* disagreements and conflicts among participants → network forks or disputes
