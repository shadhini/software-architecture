# On-Chain Data vs Off-Chain Data

> Blockchain is most often a **solution component**, **not a solution itself**!

* Blockchain can be used with other technologies such as
  * databases&#x20;
* **Not all data has to live on-chain**
  * **On-chain data can be linked to off-chain data**
    * greater speed and performance of database + benefits of blockchain
    * useful in scenarios where we need to make certain pieces of data go away

#### Example Scenario: `GDPR's Europeon citizens right to be forgotten`

* `GDPR` is often cited as a reason not to use blockchain in scenarios where personal information about users needs to be stored —  as any users' personal information should be permanently deleted upon user request to be compliant with GDPR
  * This does not have to be the case
  * "personal information" can be stored on other solution components such as database
  * but proofs or markers of that data such as cryptographic hashes can live on chain providing all the data security and integrity benefits in a blockchain
