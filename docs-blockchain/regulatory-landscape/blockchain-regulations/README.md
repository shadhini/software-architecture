## Direct Regulation

> laws, rules, and regulations related to blockchain or cryptocurrency are **explicitly stated by the government**&#x20;



## Indirect Regulation

> laws, rules, and regulations related to blockchain or cryptocurrency are **not explicitly stated by the government**&#x20;

* Generally involves the application of broader laws to blockchain-specific organizations
  * e.g: a law affecting all high tech companies will naturally affect blockchain, even if this is not explicitly stated
* indirect regulation contains the **most ambiguity**&#x20;
  * consider **hiring a legal professional** who specializes in this area
