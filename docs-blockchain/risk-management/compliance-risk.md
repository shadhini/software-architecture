## Compliance Risk

* **Data Privacy and GDPR**

  * immutability and decentralization — conflict with the right to be forgotten, other data subject rights
* **Regulatory Uncertainty**
  * rapidly evolving regulatory landscape — uncertainty for businesses
  * classification of tokens, ICOs, smart contracts — compliance challenges if regulations change unexpectedly
* **KYC and AML Requirements**
  * organizations must implement robust identity verification and transaction monitoring processes
* **Cross-Border Transactions**
  * ﻿﻿blockchain operates across borders — compliance with different international regulations —  complex
  * ﻿﻿transferring assets/data across jurisdictions — taxation, export controls, legal recognition
* **Smart Contract Enforceability**
  * legal enforceability of smart contracts —  unclear in some jurisdictions
  * smart contract interpretation, liability, dispute resolution mechanisms may not align with traditional legal frameworks
* **Licensing and Intellectual Property**
  * ﻿﻿if involves software/intellectual property — must adhere to software licensing agreements & intellectual property rights
  * ﻿﻿smart contracts can inadvertently[^1] breach licenses or infringe copyrights
* **Consumer Protection**
  * blockchain-based platform consumers exposed to risks  — if they are not informed about the technology's intricacies, potential losses, vulnerabilities
* **Token Regulations**
  * ﻿﻿ff tokens are used for crowdfunding / investment purposes — they fall under securities regulations

* **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**
  * ﻿﻿flaws in smart contract → unintended consequences, breaches of regulatory obligations
* **Audit and Record-keeping**
  * regulatory requirements for audit trails and record-keeping —  complicated
    * regulator may need to delete the audit trail after a certain period
