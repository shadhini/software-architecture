Guiding principles are **unique to**

* particular use case
* organization
* industry
* just the moment in time



#### Example Guiding Principle questions:



* ﻿﻿**Feature-Heavy vs Feature-Light**
  * <mark style="background-color:$info;">\[feature heavy]</mark> Do we provide value to our users by adding as many features and functions as possible ?&#x20;
    * e.g: `Adobe Photoshop`
  * <mark style="background-color:$info;">\[feature light]</mark> Do we provide value to our users by making our solution simple and easy to use and intuitive ?
    * e.g: `Google Search`:&#x20;
      * no one struggles to figure out how to use Google Search; but many of us struggle to work with Adobe Photoshop
* **Security vs Collaboration**
  * ﻿﻿<mark style="background-color:$info;">\[security]</mark> Do we provide value to our users by maximizing the barriers between them?
    * e.g: Online banking application
  * <mark style="background-color:$info;">\[collaboration]</mark> Do we provide value to our users by making it easy to collaborate and share information?&#x20;
    * e.g: `Instagram`
* **Consistent vs Custom User Experience**
  * <mark style="background-color:$info;">\[consistency]</mark> Do we treat all users the same?&#x20;
    * e.g: Social Media
  * <mark style="background-color:$info;">\[specialization]</mark> Or do we create a unique experience based on who each user is?&#x20;
    * e.g: Online Role Playing Game
