## Definition of "`Success`"

{% hint style="warning" %}
#### Leaving stakeholders to define success subjectively is a recipe for disaster!

failing to **define success in objective terms** during the design phase

╰┈➤ disagreement at the end of a project regarding its overall success

* at the end, some stakeholders decides your project is a success
* others decides it's a failure
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
All definitions of success have to be **measurable objectively**.

╰┈➤ Use **SMART** **goals** framework for setting well-defined objective goals

* helps to remove the subjectivity
{% endhint %}
