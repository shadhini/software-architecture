# Enterprise Risk

## Enterprise Risks

— enterprise risks associated with using blockchain —&#x20;

* ﻿﻿**Technology Failures**
  * ﻿﻿**Smart Contract Bugs and Vulnerabilities**
    * ﻿﻿coding errors, vulnerabilities
    * unintended outcomes, security breaches, financial losses
  * ﻿﻿**Network Vulnerabilities**
    * hacking attempts, 51% attacks, other malicious activities
  * ﻿﻿**Scalability Issues**
    * transaction throughput, latency
* **Stakeholder Alignment**
  * **Lack of Consensus**
    * Achieving consensus among stakeholders can lead to conflicts and delays
      * governance rules
      * protocol upgrades&#x20;
      * changes to the blockchain&#x20;
  * **Adoption Challenges**
    * getting all relevant stakeholders on board is a complex process — partners, customers, regulatory bodies&#x20;
* **Solution** [**Viability**](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]
  * ﻿﻿**Economic Incentives**
    * ﻿﻿blockchain solutions —  often involve tokens or cryptocurrencies
    * economic model and incentives — must ensure participation and alignment of stakeholders' interests
  * ﻿﻿**Regulatory Uncertainty**
    * evolving laws, differing regulations in different jurisdictions — challenging
  * ﻿﻿**Long-Term Viability**
    * risk of the technology becoming obsolete
      * more efficient alternatives
* **Data Privacy and Security**
  * ﻿﻿**Public vs. Private Blockchain**
    * trade-offs: data privacy, control, access
    * public blockchains: expose sensitive data to the public
    * private blockchains: limited decentralization
  * ﻿﻿**On-Chain Data**
    * stored data — immutable
    * sensitive/personal data: difficult to correct inaccuracies and comply with GDPR
* **Interoperability and Integration**
  * **Legacy Systems Integration**
    * Integrating blockchain with existing legacy systems — complex and costly
  * **Interoperability Challenges**
    * different blockchains — varying standards and protocols
* **Financial Considerations**
  * **Costs**
    * development, infrastructure, operational costs
    * costs might not always justify the benefits — especially for small-scale applications
  * **`ROI`: Return on Investment**&#x20;
    * measuring `ROl` — challenging
      * caz benefits might be long-term and difficult to quantify
