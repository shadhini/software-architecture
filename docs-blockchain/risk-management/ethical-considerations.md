# Ethical Considerations

## Ethical Considerations

* **Privacy Concerns**
  * data immutability and transparency conflict with individuals' privacy rights
* **Data Security**
  * although blockchain is considered secure ...
  * vulnerabilities in smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, software implementations → data breaches or unauthorized access
* **Immutable Mistakes**
  * errors/inaccuracies in transactions, contracts, data stored → cannot be easily corrected → long-lasting mistakes
* **Environmental Impact**
  * some consensus mechanisms consume significant energy
* **Digital Divide**
  * not all individuals have equal access to the internet/technological resources required to participate in blockchain networks — potential exclusion&#x20;
* **Smart Contract Complexity**
  * complex smart contracts — unintended consequences / unforeseen behaviors that have ethical implications
    * when they involve financial transactions / sensitive data&#x20;
* **Data Ownership and Control**
  * control over data stored on a blockchain ledger —  not always be in the the hands of data subjects
  * ethical questions around access, ownership, consent, management, validation
* **Identity and Anonymity**
  * blockchain's transparent nature — compromise users' pseudonymity/anonymity
* **Decentralization vs. Control**
  * ethical dilemmas related to the balance between decentralization and the need for control and governance
