# Caesar cipher

## Caesar cipher

one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques, named after _Julius Caesar_

> a type of **substitution cipher**, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of positions in the alphabet

* now considered very insecure —  can be easily cracked by trying all possible shifts —  **brute force**

e.g:&#x20;

with a shift of 3:

* **A** becomes **D**
* **B** becomes **E**
* **C** becomes **F**, and so on.
