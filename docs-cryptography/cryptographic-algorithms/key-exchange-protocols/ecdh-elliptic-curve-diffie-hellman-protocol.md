# ECDH: Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Protocol

## `ECDH`: **Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman** Protocol

> * built on principles of `DH` protocol
> * uses **elliptic curve cryptography**



### **Key Features of ECDH**

* Efficiency
  * generates keys faster than `DH` protocol
  * ideal for real-time applications: video calls, instant messaging
* Smaller key sizes
  * ECDH can achieve the same level of security as traditional methods with much smaller keys&#x20;
  * reduces transmitted data
    * improves speed
    * saves bandwidth

### Real-world Relevance

* enable quick & efficient secure connections
* widely used in protocols: HTTPS
* suppports mobile and cloud applications&#x20;
