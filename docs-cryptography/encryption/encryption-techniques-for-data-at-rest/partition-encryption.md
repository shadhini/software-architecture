# Partition Encryption

## Partition Encryption

> **selective encryption for sections of the device/disk**

* enable each partition to function as a separate entity
* grants uses greater control and flexibility over access permissions and encryption levels
* used in multi-user environments
* help businesses separate work data from personal data on employee devices



### Mode of Operation

* applies encryption to each partition
  * each partition/section  operates as an independent encrypted entity
* enables customized access permission and encryption levels&#x20;
  * e.g: one partition may contain the operating system,  while another may hold user data
* only sensitive partitions are encrypted
* each partition will require separate authentication for access&#x20;



### Strengths

* offers flexible protections
  * encrypts only sensitive partitions
* reduces resource usage
* lowers encryption overhead&#x20;
* supports multiple access control
* enables distinct authentication mechanisms for different partitions
  * beneficial in shared access environments&#x20;



### Limitations

* prone to vulnerabilities in non-encrypted areas&#x20;
* requires detailed access control and management
  * managing multiple encrypted partitions can be complex&#x20;
