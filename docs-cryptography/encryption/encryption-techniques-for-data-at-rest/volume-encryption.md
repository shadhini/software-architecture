# Volume Encryption

## Volume Encryption

> **encrypts a logical volume** (storage areas)&#x20;
>
> &#x20;   encompassing multiple files, folders/directories: network drives, or entire disk partitions
>
> &#x20;   can span multiple partitions

* used in enterprise environments to secure shared data repositories

### Mode of Operation

* creates a **secure** **container** for storing sensitive data within a disk, storage device or storage space on a file system
* requires a password for access&#x20;
* prevents access when the user is logged out&#x20;

e.g: a person might encrypt a volume that stores all their photos — ensuring that only they can access them by unlocking the volume with a password

### Strengths

* provides compartmentalized security
* protects specific logical areas without encrypting entire disk
* enables selective access control
  * allow only users with the correct credentials to access the encrypted volume
* supports dynamic storage
  * users can add or remove files within the volume as needed
  * maintain the flexibility of regular file storage

### Limitations

* access to the encrypted volume requires authentication for each & every access&#x20;
  * can be inconvenient
* offers limited security beyond the volume
