# TLS: Transport Layer Security

## `TLS`: Transport Layer Security

> **secures internet communication**
>
> * provides **end-to-end encryption** for **data transmitted between web servers and clients**; such as browsers&#x20;



### Mode of Operation

* use asymmetric encryption to initiate a secure session —  known as a **`handshake`** between a client and a server
* generates a shared key
* this shared key is then used for symmetric encryption to secure data throughout the session



### Applications&#x20;

* commonly used in **`HTTPS`**: `HTTP Secure` for secure web browsing, email, and other internet-based applications



### Strengths&#x20;

* offers robust encryption and data integrity&#x20;
* enable authentication without significantly impacting performance
