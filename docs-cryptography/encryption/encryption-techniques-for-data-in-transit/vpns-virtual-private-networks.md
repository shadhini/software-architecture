# VPNs: Virtual Private Networks

## `VPN`s: Virtual Private Networks

> create an encrypted secure virtual tunnel for data transmission across public networks; between your device and the internet&#x20;
>
> &#x20;   using tunnelling protocols, often combined with encryption

* helps to hide your IP address and location
* protect information transmitted from and to your device from eavesdropping
* used in unsecured networks
  * public WiFi in cafes/airports&#x20;
* make online activities difficult to monitor

  * businesses commonly use VPNs to ensure secure remote access to company networks&#x20;
* bypass geo-restrictions
* enhance online privacy
  * by masking users' IP addresses and encrypting their internet traffic&#x20;



### Advantages

* provide data confidentiality and integrity
* protection against interception
* ensure security of sensitive information, even on public networks&#x20;
