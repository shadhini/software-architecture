# SHA Family Algorithms

## `SHA`: `Secure Hash Algorithm` Family Algorithms

* most popular hashing algorithm for securing digital data&#x20;
* developed by the `National Security Agency`&#x20;
* this family includes **`SHA-1`**, **`SHA-2`**, **`SHA-3`**
  * each designed to meet specific security needs
* evolved to handle the growing demands of digital systems



#### SHA-1

* generates a 160-bit hash
* widely used for: digital certificates, signatures, file integrity checks
*   vulnerable to collision attacks&#x20;

    * unsuitable for secure applications



#### SHA-2

* created to address the weaknesses of SHA-1
* offers multiple versions with hash lengths of 224, 256, 384, 512-bits
  * provides varying levels of security
  * longer hash lengths offer stronger protection

* **`SHA 256`** → the most widely used algorithm for secure applications
  * blockchain
  * digital signatures
  * offers strong resistance to cryptographic attacks
  * versatile
  * trusted choice for safeguarding sensitive data&#x20;



#### SHA-3

* the newest in the SHA family
* designed to address advanced cryptographic threats
* uses a unique **`Keccak-based structure`**&#x20;
  * unlike SHA-1 & SHA-2
* offers stronger security for high-risk environments
* design ensures long-term resilience&#x20;
* ideal for applications requiring the highest level of protection against future attacks&#x20;
