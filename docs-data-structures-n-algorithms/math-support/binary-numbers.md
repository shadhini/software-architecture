# Binary Numbers

Computers started using `electronic tubes or relays` ➡ then **`transistors`**.

* All of which could be used to represent 2 states and quickly change from one to the other.

* We either have something in the **memory cell** or not.
* Conventionally, we group information in **8-digit binary numbers**.
* An 8-digit binary number may represent each of 256 possible values from 0-255.

#### Binary Number: Digits Used & Operations

0, 1

convert decimal to binary --> Divide by 2 and note down the remainder

convert binary to decimal --> from left to write multiply each digit by 2<sup>0</sup>=1, 2<sup>1</sup>=2, 2<sup>2</sup>=4, .. and so on and then add them together

least significant bit -> left most digit

most significat bit -> right most digit

#### Binary Code&#x20;

— Way of representing information using only two symbols: 0 and 1. —&#x20;

Examples:

* English text encoded with **`ASCII code`** (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
  * each character in the text string was&#x20;
    * originally represented by a **7-digit binary number** (lowercase _a_ is 1100001, and so on…).&#x20;
    * now it uses **8 bits**
* Colors encoded with **RGB** (**Red, Green, Blue**)&#x20;
  * color encoding system stores 3 binary values, 1 binary number for each color, representing the saturation of red, green, and blue color components respectively

#### Formatting Binary Numbers&#x20;

When formatting binary numbers to have a fixed length, insignificant zeros are added to the left side of the number.

Example:

* **triads:** 000, 001, 010, and so on;
* **tetrads:** 0110, 0111, and so on;
* **8-digit numbers:** 00000000, 01010101, and so on.
