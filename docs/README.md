## Software Architecture

> **Software Architecture**:
>
> **high-level structure of a software system**
>
> involves&#x20;
>
> * Organization of software components
> * Relationships between components&#x20;
> * Interactions between components to achieve the system's goals



### **Focus**:

— the **internal structure of the software —**&#x20;

including the **design** of the system's

* **modules**,&#x20;
* **components**,&#x20;
* **interfaces**, and&#x20;
* **data flow**



### **Scope**:

* generally limited to a single software application or system



### **Key Elements**:

* **Components/Modules**: Individual pieces of software that perform specific functions.
* **Interfaces**: Interaction points between components.
* **Data Flow**: How data moves within the system.
* **Design Patterns**: Reusable solutions to common design problems.
* **Technical Constraints**: Decisions driven by requirements (performance, scalability, security, etc.).
