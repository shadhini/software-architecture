# Component-based Architecture

## Component

#### characteristics

1. Reusable
2. Replaceable
3. Independednt
4. Extensible
5. Encapsulated: doesn't expose its specific implementation
6. Non-context specific

#### examples

* **`API`**
* **`DAO`**: Data Access Object → interface for the database
* **`Controller`**: know which are the components needs to be called for a particular event
  * controls the flow of data between 2 other components



## Component-based Architecture

> * decomposes system into logical independent components
> * defines, composes, and implements loosely coupled independent components&#x20;
>   * so they work together to create an application
