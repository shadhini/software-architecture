# Distributed Systems

## Node

> any device on a network that can&#x20;
>
> * recognize,
> * process, and
> * transmit data to other nodes
>
> on the network&#x20;

## Distributed Systems

> **Distributed system** is consist of **multiple interconnected nodes** running services in SOA
>
> * **multiple services** located on **different machines**
> * services coordinate interactions by message passing via a **communication protocol**
>   * such as `HTTP:Hypertext Transfer Protocol`   &#x20;
> * **appears** to the end-user **as a single coherent system**, although it operates on multiple machines

#### Distributed System Characteristics

* Shares resources
  * hardware, software, data
* Fault-tolerant
  * even if a node or service fails, system continues to run
  * system may change during execution, without service interruption
* Multiple activities run concurrently&#x20;
* Scalable
* Runs on a variety of computers
* Programmed in a variety of languages



#### Distributed System Architectures

* client-server
* 3-tier
* peer-to-peer
* microservices
