# SOA: Service Oriented Architecture

## Service

> **Services**
>
> similar to components, but
>
> * designed to be **deployed independently** and **reused** **by multiple systems**
> * has **one unique, always running instance** with whom multiple clients communicate
>
> **focus**: solution to a business need



## `SOA`: Service Oriented Architecture

<kbd>Loosely Coupled | Communicate over a network | Distrubuted Systems</kbd>

> Loosely coupled application components (services) provide services to other components
>
> * through a **communication protocol**
> * typically over a network.
>
>
>
> Services are&#x20;
>
> * often larger-grained than microservices and
> * might be orchestrated using an **Enterprise Service Bus** (`ESB`)
> * **loosely coupled**
>
>
>
> Emphasizes **reusability** & **interoperability** of services.
>
> Supports building **distributed systems**.
