# CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation

## `CQRS`: Command Query Responsibility Segregation Architecture&#x20;

> **Commands** **modify** data/state,
>
> * e.g: update a user profile
>
> while **queries** **read** it,
>
> * e.g: fetch user details
>
> often using separate/different models for updating and reading data.



## Benefits

* optimizes read/write performance
* enables scaling independently



## Implementation

### Frameworks

* `Axon Framework (Java)` with event sourcing
* `EventStoreDB` for event storage

### Tips

* pair with **event sourcing** to rebuild read models
* handle **eventual consistency** between command and query sides
* use **asynchronous updates** for **reads**
* validate data consistency



## Use-cases

* An e-commerce platform with fast product searches and separate order updates.
