# Event Broker

> An **intermediary software component**&#x20;
>
> * e.g., `Apache Kafka`, `RabbitMQ`, `AWS SNS/SQS`
>
> that **manages the transmission of events**&#x20;
>
> between event producers and event consumers.&#x20;
>
>
>
> It&#x20;
>
> * receives events,&#x20;
> * may filter or transform them, and&#x20;
> * routes them to the appropriate subscribers.
