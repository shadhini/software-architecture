# Code Style

#### Self-documenting code

Written in a way that's readable and doesn't conceal its intent

* names of the functions and variables should reflect their purpose
* explanatory text for complex logics coded with comments

#### Use of Comments&#x20;

* **comments** can be used to&#x20;
  * leave notes to your future self or to other developers to remind you of what needs to be improved and why&#x20;
  * to explain complex code snippets
