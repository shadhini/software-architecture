### **Proof of Concept (PoC):**

* Purpose: Determines if an idea or technology is feasible to build.
* Scope: Usually a limited, internal project—a technical demo, simulation, whitepaper, or mini product.
* Focus: Technical validity and risk reduction, not usability or design.
* Audience: Internal stakeholders and technical teams; sometimes for investors.
* Outcome: Validates whether a solution can be created; not intended for end users or revenue.
* Example: Testing if a new AI model can process data real-time before building it into a product.



### **Prototype:**

* Purpose: Creates tangible, visual, or interactive representations of product ideas.
* Scope: Demonstrates user experience, workflow, and aesthetics; typically without a functioning backend.
* Focus: Design, feel, and user interaction; not a working product.
* Audience: Stakeholders, project teams, and sometimes test users for feedback.
* Outcome: Facilitates design validation and iteration before serious development starts.
* Example: Clickable mockups for a mobile app interface made in `Figma` or `Sketch`.



### **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):**

* Purpose: Launches the simplest functional version of the product with core features.
* Scope: Fully operational product, but only with essential features; built for release to real users.
* Focus: Market validation with actual usage and user feedback.
* Audience: Real customers and early adopters.
* Outcome: Tests business assumptions and product-market fit; helps guide further investments.
* Example: A basic web app that solves the main user problem and collects feedback.
