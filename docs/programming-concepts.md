# Programming Concepts

* **`Identifiers`**: program component with a custom-named label
  * Constants&#x20;
  * Variables
* **`Containers`**: special type of identifier to reference multiple program elements
  * e.g. use case: to store 1000+ integers&#x20;
    * **`Arrays`**: fixed size, elements stored in sequential order&#x20;
    * **`Vectors/Dynamic Arrays`**: dynamic size; automatically resize when elements are added or removed
* Functions
* Objects
  * properties
  * methods



## Branching & Looping Programming Logic

evaluate **`boolean expresions`** for branching & looping

#### Branching Vs Looping

> **Branching**: deciding what actions to take
>
> **Looping**: deciding how many time to perform an action

#### Branching Statements

* **`if`**:
* **`if-then-else`**:
* **`Switch`**:&#x20;
* **`GoTo`**: performs a one way transfer of control to another line of code
  * in contrast, a function call typically returns control



#### Looping Statements

* **`While`**: condition is evaluate before processing the body
* **`For`**: initial value performed once, condition tests and compares, if false is returned, loop is stopped
* **`Do-While/Exit controlled loop`**: condition is always executed after the body of the loop
