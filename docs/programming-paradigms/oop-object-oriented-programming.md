# OOP: Object Oriented Programming

## `OOP`: Object Oriented Programming

Everything based on the concept of `objects`.

**`Objects`** contain

1. **`Data`**` ``(state)`
2. **`Methods`**` ``(behaviour)`; operations on the data; functions that modify data; Methods change the state of an object.

<kbd>In object oriented programming, we bring together data and methods that operate on a single object.</kbd>

***



<kbd>**In OOP, objects interact with each other to perform tasks.**</kbd>

&#x20;  e.g: car&#x20;

* Car has many collaborating objects inside it.
* Almost all of these objects are **`replaceable`** and **`reusable`**.
* If any of them malfunction, technician can replace it with another.

&#x20;  âž¯ Application in OOP is like a car.

***



## Benefits of Object Oriented Programming

* **Reduced Complexity**
  * By breaking down a large, complex application into small more manageable and easier to maintain objects.
* **Easier Maintenance**
  * If object is not working properly, we can only focus on that object only.
  * We can fix that object or plug in another as a replacement.
* **Code Reuse**
  * Once we build and test an object we can use it in other applications.
* **Faster Development**
