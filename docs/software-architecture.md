# Software Architecture

## Software Architecture

> **— blueprint and represents the underlying organization of the application —**&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
Software Architecture&#x20;

**accommodates changing requirements** during development.
{% endhint %}

#### Comprises ...

* fundamental structures of a software system
* explains the behavior of that system

#### Defines ...

* how components interact
* operating environment
* design principles&#x20;
* captures early design decision that are often costly to change once implemented
* addresses non-functional aspects
  * performance
  * scalability
  * maintainability
  * interoperability
  * security
  * manageability

#### Architectural design influences Tech Stack

* guides technology stack choice
* tech stack must address non-functional capabilities
* tech stack include
  * software programming languages
  * libraries
  * frameworks

#### Architectural design influences Production Environment

**Deployment considerations**

* servers
* load balancers
* databases

#### Artifacts Produced&#x20;

* **`SDD`**: Software Design Document
  * tech specs regarding design implementation
  * provides&#x20;
    * functional description of the software
    * design considerations
      * assumptions
      * dependencies
      * constraints
      * requirements
      * objectives&#x20;
      * methodologies
* **Architectural Diagram**
  * displays
    * compoenents&#x20;
    * their interactions
    * constraints&#x20;
    * confines
    * architectural patterns: general, reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems&#x20;
* **`UML`**: Unified Modeling Language Diagrams
  * communicates structure and behaviour&#x20;
  * not constrained by a programming lanuage
