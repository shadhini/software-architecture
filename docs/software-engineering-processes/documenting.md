# Documenting

## Software Documentation

— should be provided to both non-technical end-users and technical users —&#x20;

**technical users**: engineers, developers, or architects



* formats: written, video, graphical&#x20;
* applicable across all the phases of SDLC
* **audience** varies
  * end users
  * software developers
  * QA engineers
  * system administrators
  * other stakeholders
* **categories**:  product documentation & process documentation
* ✅️ documentation must be kept up to date & should also be reviewed periodically to ensure its accuracy
* in SDLC, **updating** documentation happens during the **maintenance** **phase**



## Product Documentation

> **— product’s functionality —**&#x20;

### Requirements Documentation

> — the expected features and functionality of the software system —&#x20;

* written during the **planning phase** of the SDLC &#x20;
* intended for:&#x20;
  * the **development team**: developers, architects, and QA personnel
* includes
  * **SRS**: Software Requirements Specifications
  * **SysRS**: System Requirement Specifications&#x20;
  * **User Acceptance Specifications**



### Design Documentation

> — **explain how the software will be built to meet the requirements** —&#x20;

* written by the **software architects** and the **development team**&#x20;
* consists&#x20;
  * **conceptual** design documents &#x20;
  * **technical** design documents

### Technical Documentation

* includes&#x20;
  * **comments** written in the code to help other developers read the code to understand its behavior
  * **working papers** that explain how the code works &#x20;
  * documents that record **engineers’ ideas and thoughts** during project implementation

### Quality Assurance Documentation&#x20;

* includes&#x20;
  * all documents that pertain to a **testing team’s** **strategy**, **progress**, and **metrics**

#### Types of Test Documentation&#x20;

* Test plans
* Test data
* Test scenarios
* Test cases
* Test strategies
* Traceability matrices: map test cases to their requirements

### User Documentation

> — **explains how to operate the software & help end-users to install/troubleshoot the system** —&#x20;

* provided to the **non-technical end-users** to assist them in the use of the product
* generally, user documentation is provided in the form of&#x20;
  * user guides
  * instructional videos &#x20;
  * user manuals
  * online help&#x20;
  * inline help&#x20;
  * FAQs: frequently asked questions
  * installation guides &#x20;
  * help guides
  * tutorials

### System Documentation

> — explains how the software operates or how to use it —&#x20;

* geared towards the **technical** user
* consists of&#x20;
  * README files
  * inline comments
  * architecture and design documents
  * verification information&#x20;
  * maintenance guides

## Process Documentation

> **— how to complete a task —**&#x20;
>
> provides&#x20;
>
> * an overview of a process &#x20;
> * the requirements for the quality implementation of a business process

### `SOPs`: Standard Operating Procedures

> — **written instructions detailing an organization's specific procedure** —&#x20;

* accompany process documentation &  go through much greater detail
* **explains step-by-step how to accomplish** a common, yet **complex task** that is **organization**\
  **specific**
  * e.g:&#x20;
    * checking in code using a code repository is common knowledge for a software engineer
    * however, an organization might have specific steps to follow for that organization in order to get code merged into the main branch
* Types of SOPs:&#x20;
  * flowchart
  * a hierarchical outline
  * step-by-step instructions
