# Software Versions

## Software Versions

Software version numbers vary in length and meaning; however, most version numbers follow a similar format and represent similar information.&#x20;



### Software Versioning

> — how software developers keep track of new software, updates, and patches for programs and applications —&#x20;



### Software Version Numbers

{% hint style="info" %}
Software version numbers are identified in the **About** or **Help** section of software.
{% endhint %}

#### Version numbers indicate&#x20;

* when the software was released
* when it was updated&#x20;
* if any minor changes or patches were made to\
  the software

#### Version numbers can have 2-4 number sets

Each number set is divided by a period.&#x20;

<kbd>1.0</kbd>

* the **first release** of an application or program
* indicate no updates, patches, or fixes to the software

<kbd>0.9</kbd>

* a version **still in beta or testing** could have a version number **lower than 1**

<kbd>7.7.9.0</kbd>

* a program or application **with many releases and updates** will have a longer number
* sometimes 4 different number sets within the version number&#x20;

#### Some software developers may use dates for their versioning.&#x20;

* Ubuntu Linux version 18.04.2
  * released in 2018 April
  * The third number set <kbd>.2</kbd> designates an additional change or update

#### Some version numbers follow the `semantic numbering system` &#x20;

* have 4 parts separated by a period
* first number: indicates major changes to the software, such as a new release
* second number: indicates that minor changes were made to the software&#x20;
* third number: indicates patches or minor bug fixes
* fourth number: indicates a build number or a build date, and it can indicate less significant changes made



## Version Compatibility

* Lack of compatibility between old and new versions of software is a common problem.&#x20;
* You should view the version of the software you are using to determine software compatibility.



#### Backword Compatible Software

> If a program or application is **backwards compatible,**\
> ╰┈➤ then the older versions of files, programs, and systems will work properly with newer versions
