# Software Engineering

## Software Engineering

> **— application of scientific principles to the design & creation of software —**&#x20;

## Responsibilities of a Software Engineer

> * Designing, building , and maintaining software systems
> * Writing & testing code
> * Consulting with stakeholders, third party vendors, security specialists, and other team members

## Software Engineers vs Software Developers

> **Software Engineers** build systems.
>
> **Software Developers** implement specific functionalities.



## Software Development Standardization

Standardized methods in software development allow for large, complex solutions that scale rather than ad hoc programming.

## CASE: Computer-aided Software Engineering

> **`CASE`: Computer-aided Software Engineering**&#x20;
>
> — use of software tools and applications that assist in the development, maintenance, and management of software systems —&#x20;



`CASE tools` are introduced to address software crisis in 1980s and they are divided in to 6 categories.

1. Business Analysis & Modelling
2. Development Tools such as  Debugging environments
3. Verification & Validation Tools
4. Configuration Management
5. Metrics & Measure
6. Project Management
