# Teamwork in Software Engineering

✅️ Define and confirm roles: avoid **duplication of efforts or missed tasks**

## Teamwork in Software Engineering

#### Kick-off Meeting

* projects are started with a kick-off meeting
* plan the project
* assign tasks
* agree on goals

#### Team / Sub Team Meetings

* to track progress & issues

#### Design & Code Reviews

* requested at the team level&#x20;
* undertaken by whoever has availability at that point in time

#### Walkthroughs

* team members present walkthroughs of their sections of responsibility to
  * the rest of the team
* key team members present walkthroughts to stakeholders&#x20;

#### Retrospectives

* when a project is complete, retrospective meetings may be held to review&#x20;
  * what went well
  * what could be improved in the future projects

#### Mentoring

* mentor may or may not be in mentees current project team

#### Teams working on internal projects

internal projects such as&#x20;

* defining code standards
* maintaining/updating legacy cross-project code
* reviewing potential new software for usefulness to the team



## Squads

> — small teams used in **agile** development  —&#x20;

* small team of up to **10 developers**
  * **squad leader**: acts as the anchor developer and coach for the squad
  * software engineers / product developers
  * 1-2 UX developers / Designers
* may practice **`pair programming`**
  * work together in pairs&#x20;



## Pair Programming

> — **2 developers** work side-by-side @ **one computer** —&#x20;

* side-by-side
  * either physically on same computer \[`preferred option`]
  * or virtually via video or shared screens
* agile development technique
  * 2 developers plan & discuss their ideas continually as they create a solution, generally resulting in a better end product

### Styles of Pair Programming

1. **`Driver / Navigator`** Style
   * most common
   * one developer → the driver —  types the code
   * other developer → the navigator — reviews code as it's written & gives directions where to go next
     * keeps an eye on the bigger picture of the overall solution
   * important to regularly swap roles to keep both of the pair engaged across the whole task
2. **`Ping-pong`** Style
   * incorporates **test-driven development**
   * for each task
     * first developer → writes a failing test
     * second developer → writes code to pass the test
   * important to swap roles regularly&#x20;
   * 2 developers work together at the end of each task refactoring the successful code to refine and improve it
3. **`Strong`** Style
   * pair a junior programmer with an experienced one
   * **defining rule**: for an idea to go from your head to the computer, it must go through someone else's hands
   * navigator → more experienced of the pair&#x20;
   * driver → junior programmer learns from witnessing their implementation and thought processes
   * for this to work:
     * the driver shouldn't challenge any ideas until the full implementation is complete
     * to not interrupt the flow of ideas from the navigator



### Benefits

* share knowledge & skills
* builds soft skills
* fewer typos, logic errors, bugs
* code review on the fly — doesn't replace formal code reviews
* identify optimal solution early on
* overall efficiency&#x20;



### Challenges

* exhausting
  * require long periods of focus
* personal and work commitments impacting schedule
* one person taking control
* personality clashes&#x20;
* noisy environment
  * when multiple sets of par programmers are present
