# UML Diagrams

## UML: Unified Modelling Language Diagrams

UML

* programming language agnostic

#### Advantages

* plan behaviors and structures in advance
* bring new team members up to speed quickly
* facilitates communication between technical & non-technical audience
* navigate source code: see relationships among modules
* saves time and money

## Types of UML Diagrams

1. Structural Diagrams&#x20;
   * **Class Diagram**: communicate software system structure & `OOAD`
     * shows relationship between objects  &#x20;
2. Behavioural Diagrams
   * **State Transition Diagram**: states & events
   * Interaction Diagrams: how interacting objects communicate
     * **Sequence Diagram**: communication between objects with respect to time



## State Transition Diagrams

collection of

* **states**: different states of the system
* **events**: triggering events that causes state changes

## Sequence Diagrams

display the communication between objects with respect to time

## Class Diagram&#x20;

shows how the classes in object-oriented design relate to one another
