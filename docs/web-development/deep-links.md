## Types of Deep Links

### Direct Deep Links

**Function**: Opens the app to a specific location if the app is already installed.



### Deferred Deep Links

* **Function**: If the app is not installed, redirects the user to the app store. Once installed, it takes the user to the intended in-app location.
* **Example**: A user clicks a link in an instagram story or Google search ad and after installing the app, they are directed to the exact content they were interested in.



## Fallbacks and Redirects

**Fallbacks**: Determines where to send users who click links from non-mobile devices, such as desktops.

**Redirects**: Allows directing users to another location, like a mobile website, instead of the app store.
