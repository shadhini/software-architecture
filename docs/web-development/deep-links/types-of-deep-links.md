## Direct Deep Links

**Function**: Immediately open a specific page or resource within an app if the app is already installed.



## Deferred Deep Links

**Function**:&#x20;

Navigate users to specific in-app content even if the app is not installed at the time the link is clicked.

* If the app is not installed, redirects the user to the app store.&#x20;
* Once installed, it takes the user to the intended in-app location.

**Example**:&#x20;

A user clicks a link in an instagram story or Google search ad and after installing the app, they are directed to the exact content they were interested in.
