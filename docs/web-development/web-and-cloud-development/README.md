## Front-End & Back-End Environments & Development

The environment is divided into front-end & back-end.

* **front-end developers** → add necessary glamor and appeal to a website&#x20;
* **designers** → add style to a space
* **back-end developer** → codes the structure of the website
* **front-end & back-end developers**:
  * must work together closely throughout the software life cycle
  * must understand how their respective parts will interact, before the development process can begin
* **full-stack developers** : have skills, knowledge, and experience in **both front-end and back-end** environments&#x20;
