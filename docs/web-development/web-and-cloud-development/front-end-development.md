## Front-End Development

* deals with what happens at the **client-side**; everything the user can see & interact with

{% hint style="success" %}

## Front-End Technologies

### HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SASS, LESS

* **`HTML`**: Hypertext Markup Language&#x20;
  * used to create the physical structure/format of a website&#x20;
    * elements: text, links, images, videos, page dividers, buttons
* **`CSS`**: Cascading Style Sheets

    * uniformity in look and feel
    * style
    * fonts
    * colors
    * navigation
    * designs&#x20;
    * layouts
  * used for creating websites that have cross browser compatibility
    * compatible with multiple
      * browsers
      * devices: PCs , mobile devices, iPads
* **`JavaScript`**: object-oriented programming language used in conjunction with HTML & CSS
  * adds interactivity and dynamic content
* **`SASS`**: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets
  * extension of CSS
  * compatible with all versions of CSS
  * enables to use&#x20;
    * variables
    * nested rules
    * inline imports&#x20;

### JavaScript frameworks/libraries

**JavaScript frameworks/libraries**: application framework/library written in JavaScript

* **`Angular`**: opens-source framework maintained by `Google`
  * JavaScript framework
  * open-source
  * allows websites to render HTML pages quickly and efficiently
  * has built-in tools for&#x20;
    * routing &#x20;
    * form validation
* **`React.js`**: developed & maintained by Facebook
  * JavaScript library
  * open-source
  * component driven design & architecture
    * builds & renders components for a web page
  * not a complete suite of tools
    * e.g: routing is not a part of this framework&#x20;
      * routing need to be added using a third party tool
  * only helps **build and drop components** into a page
  * **props** and **states** to hold the state of the application
  * faster & efficient than `Angular.js`
  * easier to learn
  * resolves cross browser issues
  * use **`JSX`**: `JavaScript XML` which is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with React
    * helpful when working with UI inside the JavaScript code
    * shows more useful error & warning messages
* **`Vue.js`**: maintained by the community&#x20;
  * lighter weight JavaScript framework with less capabilities
  * open-source
  * main focus: the view layer which includes&#x20;
    * user interface
    * buttons
    * visual components
  * flexible
  * scalable
  * integrates well with other frameworks
  * very adaptable - it can be a library or it can be the framework
  * provide better performance than `Anjular.js`
